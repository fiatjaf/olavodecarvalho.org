                >A convite do dr. Helmut von Moltke, presidente da
                Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Rosenstock, participei no in&iacute;cio
                de junho deste encontro em Monticello, IL. Algumas das
                comunica&ccedil;&otilde;es apresentadas ser&atilde;o traduzidas
                e publicadas neste site em breve. N&atilde;o tive tempo ainda de
                redigir um relato dos meus encontros e
                conversa&ccedil;&otilde;es com pensadores de primeiro
                escal&atilde;o, familiares, amigos e disc&iacute;pulos de
                Rosenstock-Huessy, que ali encontrei. Digo apenas duas coisas.
                Primeira, que vi ali em quatro dias mais atividade intelectual
                criadora do que no Brasil ao longo de trinta anos. Digo isso sem
                o m&iacute;nimo exagero. O abismo que se cavou entre este
                pa&iacute;s e o resto do mundo em mat&eacute;ria de
                intelig&ecirc;ncia &eacute; imensur&aacute;vel. Nosso mergulho
                no provincianismo foi muito fundo. Talvez n&atilde;o possamos
                voltar &agrave; tona nunca mais. Devemos esse estado de coisas,
                substancialmente, ao imp&eacute;rio do marxismo
                universit&aacute;rio. Longe de recuar ap&oacute;s a queda da
                URSS, esse imp&eacute;rio se alastrou para fora do
                c&iacute;rculo acad&ecirc;mico e hoje domina toda a
                m&iacute;dia, a educa&ccedil;&atilde;o infantil, a mentalidade
                da classe m&eacute;dia, tudo enfim. No seu obstinado apego a
                mentiras j&aacute; mil vezes desmoralizadas, a nossa classe
                letrada cometeu suic&iacute;dio intelectual. A
                intelig&ecirc;ncia nacional est&aacute; morta e n&atilde;o
                ressuscitar&aacute;. Pelo menos n&atilde;o nesta
                gera&ccedil;&atilde;o.</em

                  >A segunda coisa que observei entre os participantes do
                  encontro foi que o autor de A Origem da Linguagem deixou em
                  todos eles algo mais que os tra&ccedil;os de uma pura
                  influ&ecirc;ncia intelectual. Deixou a marca de um estilo de
                  ser, de pensar e de falar, assinalado por uma simplicidade,
                  uma sinceridade e uma bondade que contrastam com tudo o que se
                  pode encontrar em qualquer outro ambiente acad&ecirc;mico do
                  universo. Cada um dos homens e mulheres com quem conversei
                  nesses quatro dias parecia algu&eacute;m que eu j&aacute;
                  conhecesse fazia tempo, um parente ou um amigo de longa data.
                  E eram pessoas que vinham de toda parte -- da
                  Su&iacute;&ccedil;a, da Inglaterra, da Alemanha, at&eacute; da
                  R&uacute;ssia e da China. Se esse ambiente prevalecesse entre
                  os intelectuais, a maior parte do charlatanismo pedante que
                  circula pelo mundo n&atilde;o existiria.</font

              >This conference was organized with the objective of discussing
              projects for the translation of Rosenstock&#8217;s work into
              several languages. In the case of my own personal project, it is
              not a project anymore, but a reality. Here is the Brazilian
              edition of Rosenstock-Huessy&#8217;s The Origin of Speech. This
              copy reached my hands from printing just a few days ago. Many
              other copies are now being distributed to Brazilian bookshops and
              libraries.

              to examine some details on the general guidelines of this
              editorial collection, and of the pedagogical use I intend for the
              translation. Also, we need to understand the Brazilian cultural
              scenario into which this book will make an entrance.</font

              collective work done by my philosophy students in City University
              Center of Rio de Janeiro (Centro Universit&aacute;rio da Cidade),
              the institution where I teach. This translation served to give my
              students the first feel of Rosenstock&#8217;s work, and also as an
              occasion to make them aware of the current state of the Portuguese
              language, seen in the light of his teaching; in such a light we
              could measure the accuracy of Rosenstock&#8217;s observations on
              the intimate relationship between grammar and society.

              truly investigative work, for there is still in Brazilian society
              very little discussion on the transformations suffered by our
              language in the last decades, and of the social crisis these
              transformations express. I can say this coordinated activity with
              my students was the first serious attempt to examine this question
              in Brazilian academe, and this attempt would have been impossible
              without the help from Rosenstock&#8217;s ideas.</font

              Created as the result of a court revolution in the XIVth century,
              Portugal was the first nation-state in Europe, while the
              Portuguese language was the last Roman language to emerge in
              History. It seems the result from this strange combination of the
              first with the last was such that, when Portuguese finally reached
              the state of a stabilized literary language with the great
              classics of the 16th and 17th centuries, the new language was
              closer to Latin than any other European language of the time, and
              it remained so until the 20th. century.

          <p>
            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              We can say that the only substantial difference separating it from
              Latin is the supression of Latin declensions, efficiently
              substituted by a rich stock of prepositions. The most startling
              similarity is that the rich system of Latin verbal tenses remained
              practically the same in modern Portuguese, while it suffered
              drastic suppressions and modifications in other Roman languages.
              For instance, Latin&#8217;s more-than-perfect tense, which
              signifies a remote past as viewed from a more recent past, is
              designated in French by the composed form: &#8220;Il avait
              aim&eacute;&#8221;, English&#8217;s past perfect, he had loved. In
              Portuguese, the contracted form of the Latin more-than-perfect
              tense remained intact, while at the same time the composed form
              &#8211; which is equally Latin in spirit &#8211; was also adopted,
              so Portuguese-speaking people from Portugal, Brazil and Africa
              have at their disposal two forms of the more-than-perfect, two
              ways of viewing the remote past from the standpoint of a more
              recent past. The contracted form (&#8220;amara&#8221;,
              &#8220;louvara&#8221;, he had loved, he had praised) is used in a
              pure narrative and casual way, while the composed one &#8211;
              tinha amado, tinha louvado &#8211;, inasmuch as it breaks the
              unity of the idea between the pure meaning of the main verb and
              the temporal reference given by the auxiliary one
              &#8220;ter&#8221; (to have), serves explicitly to stress the
              anteriority of the time one is refering to. A more precise idea of
              what this means in the practical use can be obtained by the
              following difference: a novelist or a journalist that simply
              reports the previous background of an event can at ease make use
              of the contracted form &#8211; &#8220;Ele fizera isto ou
              aquilo&#8221;, he had done so and so &#8211; while an attorney at
              bar, who needs to stress the precise temporal sequence in order to
              obtain criminal proof will surely choose the composed time:
              &#8220;Ele tinha feito isto ou aquilo&#8221;, he had already done
              so and so.

          <p>
            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              So fine a distinction (as many others of similar importance) can
              be found not only in the indicative mode but also in the
              subjunctive one.</font

            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              The richness of the verbal system that Portuguese brought forth
              and developed from Latin allowed for the construct of very
              extensive sentences gathering together simultaneously several
              temporal dimensions, and a great variety of logical relationships,
              harmonically. &#8211; without loss of either unity nor clarity.

            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
              >Rosenstock-Huessy says that the great pedagogical virtue of Latin
              is that every sentence exhibits in a transparent way all the
              fabric of social relationships existing in the context of speaker
              and audience. Much of this transparency was maintained in
              Portuguese, and that permited the development of two social
              phenomena of great importance: first, Portuguese is the only
              language in which an almost literal translation of scholastic
              authors, such as St. Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scott, sounds very
              natural and requires little adaptation. Due to this, the fine
              terminology of scholastic thought could be absorbed and integrated
              in a more modern philosophical language, in the work of the
              greatest Brazilian philosopher, Mario Ferreira dos Santos, opening
              to the Portuguese language the perspective of becoming a
              wonderfully proper language for philosophy. Second, the juridical
              tradition of Portuguese comes directly from Roman Law, and thanks
              to these properties of our language it kept great precision,
              together with nuances that took form in two outstanding pieces of
              Brazilian Law: the Brazilian Civil Code of Francisco Campos and
              the Philosophy of Law by Miguel Reale.</font

          </p>
          <p>
            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              Thus, at first it would seem that a translation of Rosenstock into
              Portuguese was to find the best possible conditions to illustrate
              &#8211; through gramatical relationships &#8211; the structure of
              human society. However, what we found was precisely the opposite,
              for in Brazil the Portuguese language, in the last five decades,
              suffered a process of deterioriation and decomposition comparable
              only to the one Karl Kraus, Eric Voegelin and Rosenstock himself
              saw taking place in the German language during the thirties. The
              difference being that the richness and the efficacy of the German
              language could be maintained by German authors in exile, while the
              losses suffered by Portuguese language in Brazil, if not
              altogether irreparable, will take many decades to be corrected.

          <p>
            <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
              To begin with, two verbal persons simply disappeared from use,
              first in popular intercourse, then in literary usage, and finally
              in grammar compendiums. Those gramatical persons are &#8211; or
              were &#8211; precisely the ones Rosenstock would consider
              essential to the clarifying of social relations, and the very
              forming of human consciousness itself. They are the second
              persons, singular and plural &#8211; tu and v&oacute;s &#8211;
              corresponding to the English you. They were substituted by verbal
              compromises using the third person, derived from old respectful

              Now, how is it possible to speak with a person without saying you?
              How to distinguish the property of one or the other, if we only
              have the possessive pronouns of the third person? The difficulties
              in the construction of certain sentences of modern Portuguese are
              astounding, what makes the learning of the language so hard a task
              that even the literate classes would tend to write and speak in an
              obscure and incorrect way. Please note I am speaking but of one of
              the many losses Brazilian Portuguese suffered in the last fifty
              years. I am not aware of a similar occurrence in any other
              language in the world, being at a loss to imagine any other
              language losing two verbal persons in so short a time. But thanks
              to this and other phenomena of similar kind, the distance between
              spoken and written language in Brazil deepened to such an extent
              that the former became exceedingly confused and obscure, while the
              second often manages to sound artificial to the risk of being
              ridiculously pompous. Such situation scarcely makes it easy the
              circulation of ideas, for on the one hand people close themselves
              in simplified slogans that do not demand thought, while
              intellectuals get trapped in an empty and excessively intricate
              speech presumaby designed to give themselves an impression of
              thinking. During the last decades, intellectual decadence in
              Brazil has been so deep and extensive that gathering documents
              about that process in the several fields of mental activity
              &#8211; I was led to compose two volumes of a work called
              significantly &#8220;The Collective Imbecile&#8221;, and have
              since gathered material for three more volumes. The state of
              gradual loss of intellectual consciousness among Brazilian
              literate classes is so serious that if I was to fully describe it
              here to you, I might be justly accused of making negative
              propaganda of my country abroad.

              the popular arrangements that &#8211; born from the decomposition

              The first time the name of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy was mentioned
              before a Brazilian audience was in 1946, in a brilliant essay on
              European Revolutions written by Austrian born Brazilian literary
              critic Otto Maria Carpeaux. Carpeaux was, like Rosenstock-Huessy
              himself, a Jew converted to Christianity. Fleeing from the nazi
              invaders of his native country, he came to Brazil in 1939,
              mastered Portuguese with astounding speed and in a few years
              became the dean of Brazilian literary criticism.</font

              He wrote many books and press articles and introduced a whole
              generation of Brazilian students to many authors they had never
              heard of. But that generation passed away before it was able to
              transmit to the next anything but a tiny piece of its rich human
              and intellectual experience. Carpeaux was forgotten, and so was
              his essay to make Brazilians read Rosenstock-Huessy. My own
              generation seemed interested in nothing more than Marxism. This
              kind of oblivion signals the phenomenon that Rosenstock-Huessy
              himself calls decadence: the older generation fails to transmit to
              the new one a set of values and a meaning of life. Decadence
              entails revolution.</font

              Americans and other foreigners do not seem at all aware a
              revolution is taking place in Brazil. Many, misinformed by the
              media, believe that what is going on in Brazil is a simple
              democratic battle against corruption and poverty. But the
              campaigns against corruption never lessened corruption, having
              rather increased it, for they were simply used by the political
              left to destroy their adversaries, and not for a moral cleansing
              of the country. The fight against poverty is also more of a
              legitimizing slogan than a reality, for in no other country or
              epoch were so many people so rapidly removed from poverty by the
              mere spontaneous progress of economy. For instance, in the sixties
              more than fifty percent of our children had no schools. Today this
              number fell to two percent. People under the poverty line &#8211;
              a number that three decades ago reached forty percent of the
              population &#8211; today are but eight percent. So much progress
              and prosperity do not justify a general revolt against social
              dereliction. And yet, this revolt is much greater today than three
              decades ago. If it was not created by the increase in poverty, one
              can only find its roots in cultural and psychological causes. But
              then we might ask a Rosenstockian question: if the language is in
              decomposition to the point that even the word you disapears from
              it, can we not also expect that the whole society has great
              difficulty in becoming conscious of its own state and lives
              therefore in a state of hallucination and self-deceit, to the
              point of no longer being able to name its own evils?</font

              What is taking place in Brazil is a crisis of/in articulation.
              Wherever one looks, informal, inarticulate language proliferates
              in a hallucinating flowering of word plays of very short duration,
              untranslatable dialects that very soon are forgotten and are not
              understood by anyone. On the other hand, formal and articulate
              language holds on to repetitive schema and stereotypes that move
              further and further away from the possiblity of expressing
              reality. From this comes the general complaint againt hunger,
              precisely in the moment when poverty is fast receding.
              &#8220;Mis&eacute;ria&#8221; became only the conventional name of
              a diffuse evil whose nature no one can express. That is why,
              actually, the country&#8217;s region where there is the greatest
              rebellion and revolutionary spirit, especially in the rural areas,
              is the one with the most prosperous agriculture, and less
              incidence of poverty. Foreigners sometimes cannot imagine how
              cheap food is in Brazil. When I remember that one of the promises
              of Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal was to ensure that every American
              family had the guarantee to eat a chicken a week, and notice on
              the other hand that in Brazil even the poorest family can eat a
              chicken a day, I know exactly why this sounds untruthful abroad,
              for everyone hears about the social agitation in Brazil, and hear
              the Brazilian intellectuals themselves say that it is caused by
              desperate poverty. People hear about, for instance, the rising
              criminality rates, and associate it with extreme poverty, for that
              is the easiest association to make, but the fact is that there is
              no criminality in the poorest regions of the country, and on the
              places where, on the contrary, criminality peaked, the quality of
              living of the population has increased significantly in the past
              decades. People hear, for example, of the slums. But the word that
              designates them in Portuguese, favelas, means a house made of
              cardboard, because in the past freed slaves having found refuge
              there lived in houses made of cardboard. In these regions simply
              there are no more houses made of cardboard. There are houses made
              of brick and mortar, often with a satellite dish on top. The
              prosperity of the small construction industry inside the favelas
              was so great that a friend of mine &#8211; civil engineer and
              constructor &#8211;, a Brazilian of Canadian origin called Donald
              Stewart Jr., made a study suggesting that the model of real estate
              negotiations on the favelas served as a model for the rest of the
              country. And it was precisely in the middle of this prosperity
              boom in the favelas that the development of criminality and
              drug-dealing activities found their customers and market share.
              Regardless of that, the association between poverty and
              criminality seems to have taken over the minds and hearts of
              Brazilians to the point they do not see the peculiar
              characteristics of what is happening. People who cannot speak
              cannot think. The whole situation is a great hallucination, and I
              do not see another way to try to understand it and remedy it
              except through the Rosenstockian science of language.

              Rosenstock saw his philosophy of language not only as a theory,
              but as a remedy for the suffering of society. More than ever,
              Brazilians need to learn how to speak, so they can tell each other
              what they are really going through in the experience of life. This
              dialogue is not the easiest task at the moment. All one hears are
              angered insults on the one hand, and abstract formalities on the
              other. When we thought of translating Rosenstock, our hope was
              that this helped us to heal our own speech, and that, once healed,
              we could maybe spread around a little health.</font

              It would have been very dificult to express the fine print of
              Rosenstock&#8217;s considerations on the diseases of speech in a
              language that is very ill itself. To translate The Origin of
              Speech, we had once too often to do violence to modern Portuguese
              usage in Brazil, including the reintroduction of the two lost
              verbal persons, in such a way that the translation work in itself
              became an exercise on the therapy of language, and therefore the
              reconquering of consciousness. Every individual that took part in
              this work was transformed and stengthened by it. I have the
              impression that the same, in a smaller scale, will happen to the
              readers. For instance, in the universities where there reigns a
              strict strucuturalist and Saussurean dogmatism, or else a Marxist
              one, certain affirmations made by Rosenstock, in themselves
              obvious and undeniable, will have the effect of an electric shock
              on a catatonic patient. The affirmation, for instance, of the
              anteriority of formal and solemn language over the informality of
              everyday urban language will suddenly show to many that they have
              been studying linguistics with the wrong material. In Brazil there
              is a dogmatic belief that grammar is an instrument of domination
              invented by the rich classes to oppress the poor, and owing to
              that each new decomposition of language is celebrated as a huge
              progress, no one realizing that this phenomenon corresponds to a
              loss of the expressive ability and the widening of the abyss
              between the classes, which makes it even more difficult for people
              of poorer origin to have access to the creations of higher
              culture. Rosenstock&#8217;s book will help to build a bridge
              between those on the lower and those on the upper end of society.

              One other aspect of this translation relates to the general
              editorial collection it is inserted into. Each book in this
              collection was chosen for the fact they had two characteristics.
              Firstly, it had to be a truly precious and rare piece of work. It
              is a collection on hidden treasures. Secondly, it had to be a
              piece of work that helped to rescue and salvage the Brazilian
              spirit. To enlarge the effect of each of these books, I added to
              each of them footnotes and comments that compared them to the
              other works in the collection, creating thus a dialogue between
              philosophers that, on most cases, never met. In such notes I try
              to articulate a debate and an understanding among these thinkers,
              as if they composed the staff of a single university, in which the
              readers would be the students. I did this because, substantially,
              the universe of readers of the collection is the same as the
              students and audience of my courses and conferences. I have a few
              thousand ex-students spread all over Brazil, that follow with
              interest and often passion the activities of our circle of
              studies. It is my hope they would come to form the nucleus of a
              future Brazilian intellectual elite, in which &#8211; I pray
              &#8211; the heritage of the past centuries will be salvaged as a
              continuous line to help to build the future. Each work in this
              collection is integrated in this effort to unite different times
              through language. In my notes Rosenstock dialogues, for example,
              with the Basque philosopher Xavier Zubiri, the German Eric
              Voegelin, the Romanian Constantin Noica, and with other authors he
              never heard of and in which work we always find a wonderful
              convergence of an incredibly rich and varied human experience.

              Our edition of Rosenstock is not, therefore, an isolated editorial
              product, but an organic component of a vast pedagogical effort
