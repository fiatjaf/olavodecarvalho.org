            <p align="center">***</p>
            <p>Since my arrival in this hospitable country in May 2005, I have
              been trying to explain to Americans that Lula would never be able &#8212; much
              less willing &#8212; to help them to stop Hugo Chavez. I have spread
              this obvious truth in lectures delivered to audiences of politicians,
              journalists, strategical analysts and intelligence experts. Though
              some of them agree with me, the prevalent opinion remains unaltered:
              Lula is America&#8217;s best hope in Latin America. Even now that
              attorney-general Alberto Gonzales had to swallow an explicit refusal
              from the Brazilian government to serve as a muzzle for the Venezuelan
              mad dog, nobody from Washington has admitted that the Brazilian
              fruitcake hidden somewhere in the Virginian brushwood was right
            after all.</p>
            <p>I have been explaining, in a more general way, that Lula would
              never help the Americans to do anything against the Latin-American
              radical Left, and especially not against the FARC, the Colombian
              narcoguerrillas who inject huge annual amounts of cocaine into
              both the Brazilian and American markets. As to the many Muslim
              terrorists sheltered in the Brazilian southern border, there is
              no need to say that the Brazilian government will not support any
              action against them: it does not even recognize that they exist.</p>
            <p>Lula is the founder and one of the masterminds of the &#8220;Sao
              Paulo Forum&#8221; (I will call it the SPF), the strategic headquarters
              of the Latin-American revolutionary Left. The SPF, which gathers
              both legal parties and criminal organizations, is stronger than
              any singular Latin-American government, if we take into account
              that it has at its service dozens of terrorist gangs and the armies
              of the countries governed by its member-parties. The Brazilian
              army, reduced to tatters since the Latin-American demilitarization
              campaign inaugurated thirty years ago under the personal guidance
              of president Jimmy Carter, is unable to face a single branch of
              the SPF, such as the FARC, and much less the SPF as a whole.</p>
            <p>The Brazilian military is now so deeply conscious of its own weakness
              that its old anti-communist pride is giving way to opportunistic
              accommodations with the radical Left, using &#8220;nationalism&#8221; (
              i.e. bitter anti-Americanism) as common ground for their unholy
              alliance (you cannot imagine the amount of military hate I have
              been attracting against myself for writing about this). Lula, Lula&#8217;s
              party, and Lula&#8217;s government are nothing without the support
              of the SPF, both domestically and in Latin America.</p>
            <p>In 1990, Lula created that organization while facing near ruin
              in his political career. And later on he became a successful politician
              with the help of the FSP. If he betrays it, he will not stay alive
              for five seconds. In order to evaluate the depth of Lula&#8217;s
              party commitment to the SPF and to its self-proclaimed goal of &#8220;reconquering
              in Latin America all that was lost in Eastern Europe,&#8221; you
              should only read these lines of the message sent by the FARC to
              the SPF&#8217;s 13th general assembly, which took place in San
              Salvador last January 7th:</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In 1990 the socialist field was falling apart; all its
                structures were as weak as a castle of cards, and the enemies
                of socialism
                    were celebrating nonstop. Theories like &#8220;the End of History&#8221; were
                    being proposed, and many revolutionaries around the world
                    were astonished, not knowing what had gone wrong and enabled
                    such a
                    catastrophe. Utopia was being dissipated and hopelessness
        took over innumerable movement leaders. </p>
        <p>Cuba stood alone, enduring the worst crisis ever experienced
                        by any other country. Imperialism wrongly believed that
              the moment had come to put an end to socialism in the Americas&#8230; It was
                        in that moment that the PT (Lula&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party)
                        launched the formidable proposal to create the Sao Paulo Forum&#8230; This
                        initiative, which quickly caught on, was a lifesaver
                        and a hope that not everything was lost. How right we
                        were! Sixteen years
                  have passed and the political scene today is totally different. </em>                  </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          </p>
      </blockquote>
      <div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>In short: the communist movement was drowning, the Workers'&#8217;Party &#8212; Lula&#8217;s
                          party &#8212; saved it, and did it under Lula&#8217;s personal
                          inspiration. Every single one of the SPF member parties agrees
                          with that statement. No matter how much the World Economic Forum
                          may praise him for his alleged &#8220;conversion to capitalism,&#8221; Lula
                          is a hero of Latin-American communism and will not exchange this
              title for that of a dead traitor.</p>
            <p>There is no substantial contradiction between running a capitalist
                          economy while draining its energies to feed a growing communist
                          movement and to support the arrangements for a continental &#8220;war
                          of the whole people&#8221; against the USA, as planned by Hugo
                          Chavez. Lula&#8217;s government can be defined, alas, by that two-headed
                          strategy wisely grounded on the mutual independence between economy
              and conspiracy.</p>
            <p>Now that George W. Bush prepares to visit his so-called good friend
                          in Brasilia next March 8th, the good friend&#8217;s party and his
                          many allies in the radical Left prepare to receive the American
                          president with the largest and harshest anti-American manifestation
                          ever seen in Brazil. In the privacy of his cabinet at the presidential
                          residence in Brasilia, Lula will play America&#8217;s friend while
                          his own subordinates and followers will be right outside the palace
                          shouting &#8220;death to Yankee imperialism.&#8221; George W. Bush
                          will do his best to pretend that the protests come from Lula's
              foes. I hope he does not seriously believe it. </p>
            <p><strong>Editor:</strong> The thuggish Chavez also has his totalitarian-minded
              admirers in the Australian media, e.g., the odious Philip Adams,
              a columnist for Murdoch's Australian, and Kenneth &#8216;Chomsky&#8217; Davidson,
                          a columnist for The Age. Davidson asserted in all seriousness that &#8220;[t]here
                          is no doubt about the democratic bona fides of Venezuela&#8217;s
                          Hugo Chavez&#8221; (The Age, The pricey well-oiled
                          military superpower, 11 August 2005). He has not seen
            fit to revise his opinion. </p>
