      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr. de Carvalho,</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you 
        very much for sending me your thoughtful and eloquent analysis of the 
        current political situation in Brazil. As you know, one of my brief articles, 
        &quot;Blocking a New Axis&quot; has circulated widely by email - I am 
        told more than 400,000 brazilians have received it. It has led to an active 
        but nonfactual protest by many supporters of Lula.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thought 
        you would find it interesting to have the text of my analysis on Brazil 
        and on the Chavez regime in Venezuela - where I correctly warned about 
        his radical political actions in 1999. Also, I think the list of participants 
        at the lastest Lula organized Foro de Sao Paolo in Havanna is very indicitive, 
        as you discussed in your analysis.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Very important 
        is Lula's statement on September 14 opposing Brazil's continued participation 
        in the Nuclear Noproliferation Treaty. I am enclosing that in Portuguese 
        as well as a just-published O Globo story saying the truth that Lula supports 
        Brazil's having nuclear weapons -a fact that seems virtually unknown to 
        most voters in Brazil. </font></p>

      <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September 
        1999</font></p>
      <p align="center"> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During his 
        coming visit to the U.S., President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela hopes to 
        meet again with President Clinton. In January 1999, Col. Chavez told President 
        Clinton that his political program would be one of &quot;true democracy,&quot; 
        but in fact, he is establishing a radical military dictatorship with ominous 
        implications for the people of Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico and for the 
        United States as he moves forward with his plans for a de facto alliance 
        with Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya and communist China. Now, it is up to President 
        Clinton to exercise leadership in formulating a strategy to help the people 
        of Venezuela reestablish their democracy. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Venezuela, 
        with a population of about 23 million, is currently the largest single 
        supplier of oil to the United States. After the restoration of democracy 
        in 1958, Venezuela had been a positive example for all of Latin America 
        and had excellent relations with the United States. Unfortunately, the 
        deep recession following the 1982 and 1994 Latin American debt crises 
        severely reduced living standards where about half of the population had 
        been middle class. This, along with corruption scandals involving both 
        major democratic political parties and the effects of low oil prices during 
        the 1990s, contributed to growing public demands for reform. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During his 
        time as a military cadet, Chavez came to believe that he should lead a 
        radical military regime which would transform Venezuela. In 1992 he staged 
        a violent military coup in coalition with the armed Venezuelan communist 
        movements established with Castro's help in the 1960s. This was repelled 
        by the National Guard, equal in strength to the army.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Having been 
        given amnesty in 1995, Chavez began to focus his efforts on the political 
        process. He organized the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement, reestablished 
        his alliance with the Venezuelan Marxist-Leninist movements and began 
        working with the communist guerrillas of Colombia who helped his movement 
        in return for stolen weapons. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The first 
        tests for Chavez's new movement were the November 1998 elections for the 
        National Congress and for 22 state governorships. Contrary to their hopes, 
        the Chavez movement won only 37% of the seats in the Congress and only 
        8 of the 22 governorships. Yet, as they prepared for the December 1998 
        presidential elections, the two long established democratic parties were 
        demoralized by public disaffection with them as a result of corruption 
        in government. Only late in the campaign did they endorse the candidacy 
        of Governor Salas Romer, who led a new democratic movement, Projecto Venezuela. 
        Chavez campaigned for the presidency on a program of reform to end corruption, 
        opposition to &quot;neo-liberalism&quot; and strong criticism of the United 
        States. Chavez did not deny that his well funded presidential campaign 
        received help from Libya and Cuba (reports suggest that Saddam Hussein 
        also provided funds). In the election, Gov. Salas Romer received 40% of 
        the popular vote, while Col. Chavez won the presidency with 56%. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Since becoming 
        president on February 2, 1999, Chavez has acted systematically to establish 
        a radical military dictatorship under the guise of constitutional reform. 
        First, he appointed his fellow coup plotters to positions in control of 
        the armed forces, the intelligence service, the internal revenue service, 
        the ministry of the interior and other sensitive ministries. Second, Chavez 
        has created an atmosphere of political intimidation, in which political, 
        civic, and media leaders were called upon to support his changes or risk 
        being charged with corruption, having mobs storm their offices and homes, 
        or finding themselves or family members kidnapped by Colombian guerrillas. 
        Third, in direct violation of the constitution, Chavez has established 
        regional military committees as a form of parallel government in most 
        of Venezuela's states and has sought to force the elected governors and 
        mayors to subordinate themselves to these military committees. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Chavez called 
        a referendum in April 1999 to decide whether a Constituent Assembly should 
        be convened to write a new constitution for Venezuela. The democratic 
        parties did not feel there was any need for a new constitution. Only 39% 
        of Venezuelans voted, but the referendum passed. In the July 1999 elections 
        held for the Constituent Assembly, only a few persons dared to oppose 
        those from the Chavez movement. This reflected the fear pervading members 
        of the democratic political parties. As a result, Chavez controls 98% 
        of the Constituent Assembly. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In August 
        1999, the Constituent Assembly acted to neutralize and usurp the authority 
        of the existing judiciary and of Venezuela's elected Congress. On August 
        19, 1999, the Venezuelan Supreme Court, having been subjected to hidden 
        and open coercion, reversed its earlier decision and ruled that the Constituent 
        Assembly could declare a &quot;judicial emergency&quot; and establish 
        its own group to &quot;review and evaluate&quot; all existing judges. 
        The head of the Supreme Court resigned in protest. On August 25 the Constituent 
        Assembly declared a &quot;legislative emergency&quot; and forbade the 
        Congress from meeting. After members of the Congress protested and these 
        actions began to gain international attention, there was a temporary, 
        minor compromise with the Congress while Chavez continued to take more 
        power. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If Chavez 
        consolidates his dictatorship the people of Venezuela will experience 
        the repression and poverty that the Cuban people have known for the last 
        four decades. Also, Chavez will seek to help radicals taker power in other 
        Latin American countries beginning with Colombia. There the elected government 
        faces three armed opponents--20,000 communist guerrillas who began with 
        Castro's help in the early 1960s, these are mainly financed by violent 
        narcotics traffickers, some of whom also fund and use the third armed 
        group, anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces. The actions of Chavez make 
        it clear that he seeks to help the Colombian guerrillas win directly or 
        by means of a &quot;power-sharing&quot; negotiated political settlement. 
        Chavez will also use the slogans of &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;ending 
        corruption&quot; to help radicals take power in other fragile countries 
        such as Mexico.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A key Chavez 
        advisor defines the U.S. Europe and Israel as the &quot;white Judaic North,&quot; 
        oppressing the poor of the world and requiring the Chavez regime to ally 
        itself with the anti-U.S. oil producers--Libya, Iran, Iraq and communist 
        China. Chavez has already coordinated closely with Iran to promote higher 
        oil prices, he has invited Saddam Hussein to the OPEC summit in Venezuela 
        and he has agreed to provide Venezuelan oil to Cuba at a steep discount. 
        Chavez will seek ever higher oil prices both to punish the &quot;North&quot; 
        and to provide his and other radical regimes with more money to oppose 
        it and help &quot;liberate&quot; those they define as oppressed.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In April 
        1999 Senator Timiteo Zambrano, from one of Venezuela's two major democratic 
        parties, wrote the Organization of American States (OAS) stating that 
        Chavez was &quot;against the democratic system&quot; and asking for international 
        help to preserve democracy. In 1991 the OAS had unanimously agreed that 
        in the event of a threat to political democracy the members of the OAS 
        would take preventive actions. It is very late but not yet too late. President 
        Clinton has a last chance to work with democratic allies to prevent the 
        consolidation of a Chavez dictatorship-a major new threat to freedom, 
        peace and national security.</font></p>

        28, 2002</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The recent 
        events in Venzuela were dramatic. Yet much of the discussion in the United 
        States began and ended with the fact that President Hugo Chavez had been 
        &#8220;democratically elected&#8221; in 1998. Ignored were his record 
        of anti-democratic governance since taking office in 1999 , his alliances 
        with terrorist partner states like Cuba, Iraq and Iran, his sponsorship 
        of state terrorism and the implications of these facts for the future.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On April 
        9-10,2002 hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters from pro-democratic 
        political parties, labor unions, business and civic associations, walked 
        in the Venezuelan capital to show their opposition the latest anti-democratic 
        actions of Chavez. In response, Chavez mobilized his para-military armed 
        thugs, the &#8220;Bolivarian Circles&#8221; and they were televised shooting 
        the unarmed protestors killing and wounding more than 100 while others 
        sped around Caracas on motorcycles looking for journalists to attack. 
        Chavez also sent armed supporters to close down television reporting of 
        the protests. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Chavez 
        ordered the military to use force to halt the peaceful demonstrations, 
        thirty senior officers refused to obey. They said Chavez had violated 
        &#8220;democratic principles&#8221; and that they would no longer recognize 
        his authority because they wanted to &#8220;avoid more spilling of blood 
        and the destruction of our brave people and their institutions&#8221;. 
        From their point of view, those military leaders were joining a broad 
        based civic movement calling for the end of the emerging Chavez dictatorship, 
        just as had occurred in 1945 and again in 1958 when a civil-military coalition 
        removed a dictator and Venezuela began its four decades as a political 
        democracy. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Understanding 
        the reasons all the pro-democratic groups in Venezuela oppose Chavez requires 
        a brief review of his anti-democratic actions which have been mostly ignored 
        outside of Venezuela. Chavez moved Venezuela through four principal phases. 
        First, the use of illegal and pseudo-legal means to invalidate the existing 
        constitution (in force since 1961) and have a new constitution written 
        by his supporters (1999). Second, under the new constitution, having himself 
        eligible to be president for two six year terms and obtaining a unicameral 
        legislature that would give him predominant federal powers. Third, beginning 
        his &#8220;social revolution&#8221; by using presidential decrees in the 
        fall of 2001 to begin confiscating private property. The fourth phase, 
        begun in January 2002 when Chavez established the Political Command of 
        the Revolution under his direct control which would supervise the &#8220;Bolivarian 
        Circles&#8221;, an armed militia of Chavez supporters who would intimidate, 
        preempt and if necessary seek to defeat the political/civic opposition 
        and the Venezuelan armed forces. This was intended to assure his indefinite 
        continuation in power. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In April 
        1999 Chavez called a referendum to decide whether a Constituent Assembly 
        should be convened to write a new constitution for Venezuela. The major 
        democratic parties did not feel there was any need for a new constitution, 
        but demoralized and intimidated, they made virtually no effort to contest 
        the issue. The lack of citizen support for a new constitution was seen 
        in the fact that only 39% of Venezuelans voted. Venezuelans voted and 
        passed the referendum. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In July 1999, 
        elections were held to choose the delegates for the Constituent Assembly. 
        Chavez supporters were confident, active and intimidating while those 
        representing the pro-democratic parties were fearful and only beginning 
        to return to political activity. The groups opposing Chavez received 38% 
        of the votes compared to the 42% for the pro-Chavez slates of candidates. 
        Nevertheless, by a fraudulent process the pro-Chavez 42% of the votes 
        was translated into 93% of the seats in the Constituent Assembly while 
        the opposition parties received only 7% of the seats. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In August 
        1999, the Chavez-dominated Constituent Assembly assembled and immediately 
        took actions to neutralize and usurp the authority of the existing judiciary 
        and of Venezuela's elected Congress, where Chavez supporters had won only 
        20% of the seats.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On August 
        25, 1999 the Constituent Assembly, in violation of the existing constitution, 
        declared a &quot;legislative emergency&quot; and forbade the elected national 
        Congress from meeting. From that time on, the elected national Congress 
        was sidelined; this marked the Chavez regime in complete violation of 
        the Venezuelan constitution and as antidemocratic. Democratic political 
        leaders in Venezuela appealed to the OAS, the Clinton Administration, 
        and other countries to speak out against these unconstitutional actions 
        but heard only silence. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the 
        new constitution, Chavez obtained reelection as president and a new legislature 
        where his supporters held 60% of the seats, but the democratic opposition 
        parties held the rest, a sign of their revival. But independent observers 
        such as the Catholic Church questioned the accuracy of the vote counting 
        process for both the presidential and legislative elections. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chavez now 
        moved to use pseudo-electoral means to put his loyalists in control of 
        the powerful independent labor unions grouped together in the Venezuelan 
        Confederation of Labor (CTV). It has a long history of supporting political 
        democracy, opposing dictatorship, and a well organized membership of more 
        than one million strong. On December 3, 2000, Chavez held a national referendum 
        on whether all the union leaders should be dismissed from their positions. 
        With turnout only 23 percent, the referendum passed. Labor leaders claimed 
        the referendum violated the Chavez 1999 constitution, provisions of which 
        protect union leaders from state intervention. Nevertheless, the CTV leadership 
        was required to resign and run in new union elections for office where 
        80% of previous CTV leaders were reelected. Having escaped the Chavez 
        takeover attempt, the CTV labor unions have been all the more vigorous 
        in their campaign for the restoration of democracy and opposition to Chavez. 
        They have called a major demonstration for May 1st, 2002. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actions against 
        journalists have been systematic but hidden. They include anonymous threats, 
        ostensibly criminal attacks, and - perhaps most intended to intimidate- 
        sending journalists verbatim transcripts of their conversations with democratic 
        opposition leaders whether on their cell phones, in their offices, or 
        elsewhere. This disguised repression of a free press will undoubtedly 
        increase. </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Internationally, 
        Chavez has established alliances with Cuba, Iraq and Iran, all state supporters 
        of terrorism. He has provided the Castro regime with free oil, probably 
        worth two billion dollars, and worked closely with Castro in support of 
        the communist guerillas in Colombia and other anti-democratic movements 
        attacking nearby countries. Even the Clinton Administration departed from 
        its silence on Chavez, stating in December 2000 that he was supporting 
        &#8220;violent movements opposing the government of Colombia, Bolivia 
        and Ecuador&#8221;. There has been an increasing flow of credible evidence, 
        including from Chavez&#8217;s former chief of intelligence, that the Chavez 
        regime has been and remains a state supporter of terrorism through its 
        aid for the Colombian communist guerillas and other radical groups. If 
        and as Chavez consolidates his control in the coming weeks and months, 
        his actions will threaten democracy in Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru 
        and Brazil. </font></p>

        o candidato do PT &agrave; Presid&ecirc;ncia, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula 
        da Silva, criticou ontem a ades&atilde;o do Brasil ao Tratado de N&atilde;o-Prolifera&ccedil;&atilde;o 
        de Armas Nucelares. Quando o embaixador Marcos Camilo Curtis lhe perguntou 
        se ele considerava o tratado nocivo aos interesses nacionais e &agrave; 
        soberania brasileira, Lula respondeu: </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8212; Vou 
        ser muito franco, porque dentro do Congresso tem uma grande maioria de 
        parlamentares pacifistas que entende que o Brasil deveria aderir ao tratado. 
        Mas, como cidad&atilde;o, imagino que s&oacute; teria sentido se todos 
        os pa&iacute;ses que j&aacute; det&ecirc;m (armas nucleares) abrissem 
        m&atilde;o das suas. Porque se um cidad&atilde;o pede para eu me desarmar, 
        ficar de estilingue e ele de canh&atilde;o para cima de mim, qual &eacute; 
        a vantagem que eu levo? </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lula destacou 
        que ainda existem tr&ecirc;s formas de um pa&iacute;s ser respeitado no 
        mundo: tendo uma economia s&oacute;lida, muita tecnologia ou sendo forte 
        militarmente. Na sua opini&atilde;o, o &uacute;nico pa&iacute;s que tem 
        estrat&eacute;gia de longo prazo atualmente s&atilde;o os Estados Unidos,

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Em entrevista 
        ap&oacute;s a palestra no Clube da Aeron&aacute;utica, Lula esclareceu 
        sua opini&atilde;o em rela&ccedil;&atilde;o ao tratado. O candidato disse 
        que a falta de uma cl&aacute;usula que impe&ccedil;a os pa&iacute;ses 
        desenvolvidos de construir armas nucleares acabou colocando o Brasil e 
        os pa&iacute;ses subdesenvolvidos em situa&ccedil;&atilde;o de desvantagem. 
        Mas Lula afirmou que n&atilde;o h&aacute; como rever o acordo. </font></p>

        &eacute; justo que os pa&iacute;ses desenvolvidos, que t&ecirc;m a tecnologia

        uma entrevista depois do encontro com militares no Rio para abrir fogo 
        contra o petista. O tucano afirmou que Lula tem se ocultado atr&aacute;s 
        do publicit&aacute;rio da campanha, Duda Mendon&ccedil;a, e do procurador 
        da Rep&uacute;blica Luiz Francisco de Souza, que entrou ontem com uma

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ele acusou

        n&atilde;o existe at&eacute; porque pessoalmente tenho respeito pelo Lula.

        defende a bomba at&ocirc;mica, &eacute; interessante ele mostrar como. 
        Se ele defende dez milh&otilde;es de empregos, deve mostrar como. Isso

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Outro alvo

        Col&ocirc;mbia (Farc). O tucano cobrou uma posi&ccedil;&atilde;o de Lula

      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Message:<br>
        Dear friends, <br>
        Mr. Menges analysis is completely right. Mr. da Silva is a main Brazilian 
        supporter of Colombian FARC, whose representative in Brazil is Fernando 
        Beira-Mar, a cruel and sadistic criminal whose gang frightens our people, 
        our government and even our Army. Brazil is up to the point of becoming 
        a new Colombia, owing to people like Mr. Lula da Silva and Beira-Mar. 
        This is not just an opinion. It's a fact. People who try to cover facts 
        under pseudo-patrioric rethorics are not real patriots. They are just 
        stupid. <br>
        Moreover, Mr. Menges is not a US government official, he is just an intelligence 
        analyst who tries to understand what is happening in Brazil. If a simple 
        press article is an &quot;undue interference in Brazilian affairs&quot;, 
        then all press commentary in foreign newspapers concerning Brazilian politics 
        should be prohibited, except those favorable to Mr. da Silva, of course. 
        <br>
        To say that Mr. da Silva's enemies intend to &quot;overthrow the government 
        and remilitarize Brazil&quot; is a huge and cynical lie. Mr. da Silva 
        is overtly supported by the military, to whom he promises government money 
        for nuclear research (appealing to the old ambition of making Brazil an 
        anti-american atomic world power - exactly what Mr. Menges had foretold). 
        Mr. da Silva is very close to ultranationalist military, the most dangerous 
        part of Brazilian Armed Forces. <br>
        It's also a lie that the Workers Party (PT) is not a revolutionary one. 
        Some months ago a political scientist at Rio Grande, Prof. Jos&eacute; 
        Giusti Tavares, wrote that it was a revolutionary party and was sued for 
        that. He brought to Justice the evidences confirming his dyagnosis (papers 
        from the Party itself) and was acquited. Mr. da Silva himself admited 
        to his extreme-left supporters that any &quot;light&quot; tone he had 
        adopted in his electoral propaganda is just this: electoral propaganda, 
        and nothing more. <br>
        Well, some liars and telling people to read O Globo instead of believing 
        Mr. Menges. Bullshit. I am myself one of O Globo's columnists, and this 
        is what I wrote there some days ago:</font></p>

        <strong>Harvest Time </strong><br>
        Olavo de Carvalho <br>
        <em>O Globo</em> (Rio de Janeiro), September 7, 2002 </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the 
        downfall of the USSR became an accomplished fact, the Forum of S&atilde;o 
        Paulo has been, since 1990, the most powerful initiative taken to restart 
        the international communist movement and, in Fidel Castro words, &quot;to 
        regain in Latin America what was lost in East Europe&quot;. Summoned by 
        the Cuban dictator and Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, the Forum joins 
        the legal Communist (and pro-Communist) parties, engaged in the struggle 
        for cultural and political hegemony within their nations, and armed organizations 
        involved in kidnapping, terrorism and drug traffic. Among the last, the 
        outstanding one is Farc, whose connections with the Brazilian drug market 
        were proven with the arrest of Fernandinho Beira-Mar. There are also double-faced 
        organizations, both legal and illegal, like the Chilean Communist Party, 
        whose armed wing had something to do with the kidnapping of Washington 
        Olivetto. <br>
        Perhaps the readers will at first find strange a meeting in which legally 
        organized parties fraternize with criminal gangs. Actually, this association 
        only repeats the old Leninist rules that recommend the joining of legal 
        and illegal means in the revolutionary struggle. In fact one of the advantages 
        of the international alliance is to allow that the promiscuous mixture 
        of licit and illicit ways, of moralist rhetoric and drug traffic, of beautiful 
        ideals and the brutality of kidnappings, of humanitarian sentimentalism 
        and organized terror- a mix so clear and evident in continental scale, 
        and at meetings of the Forum- that it appears disguised and nebulous when 
        seen from the perspective of each separate nation. Using Argentineans 
        to act in Mexico, Bolivians in Brazil or Brazilians in Chile, the most 
        obvious connections become invisible to the eyes of local public opinion: 
        the legal parties continue above any suspicion, and the simple suggestion 
        of investigating them is rejected as an intolerable offense, when the 
        arrest of criminals shows full proof of the intimate association between 
        organized crime and leftist politics in the continent; identification 
        that becomes still more evident when the arrest of such persons is followed, 
        with magical coincidence, by the quick and effective mobilization, for 
        the criminals, of officials and &quot;decent folk&quot; of the left. <br>
        Since 1990, the Forum of S&atilde;o Paulo has been meeting regularly. 
        The tenth meeting took place in Havana, Cuba, in December, 2001. Mr. Luiz 
        In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva was there. To deny therefore that he is associated 
        politically with the other entities, signatories to the declarations of 
        the Forum, it is to deny the validity of the Brazilian presidential candidate's 
        signature on official documents of international relevance. As wrote Vasconcelo 
        Quadros in the &quot;Isto &Eacute;&quot; of March 2002, &quot;Brazil shelters 
        a secret network of support of international guerrilla organizations employed 
        in kidnappings, bank robberies and drug traffic&quot;. In a country in 
        which any phone call to a swindler is enough to place a politician under 
        police suspicion, a countrywide refusal to investigate a link enshrined 
        in public documents it is, at least, surprising. <br>
        Still more surprising is that, among so many journalistic commentators, 
        policemen, politicians and the military, all them reputed as intelligent, 
        nobody gets-or wants-to establish a logical link between those facts and 
        the declaration of Dr. Leonardo Boff, in &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; 
        of August 23, that with the next election &quot;the time for the Brazilian 
        revolution will have arrived. The sowing was already been done. It is 
        harvest time&quot;. Or, when using the word &quot;revolution&quot;, didn't 
        the retired clergyman mean anything of the sort, and that all was innocent 
        hyperbole? <br>
        The massive and obstinate refusal to face with realism this state of affairs 
        can be explained by the fact that he constitutes a dreadful reality, whose 
        vision would be too traumatic for the delicate nerves of a bourgeoisie 
        dandy, terrified to the point of no longer admitting the reality of the 
        evil that terrifies him. Psychologically kidnapped by a nameless Marxism 
        that permeates the air, the dominant class is already ripe to act its 
        role of docile, smiling and helpful victim. <br>
        But, please, don't think that with those remarks I am acting in favor 
        or against any candidate to the Presidency of the Republic. See this: 
        four candidates, with token differences, have the same ideology, and any 
        one of them, when elected, cannot govern without the support of at least 
        one or two of the other three. It is therefore of a single slate election, 
        subdivided into four temporary denominations. Perhaps what Dr. Boff will 
        not say is that the revolution will be inaugurated with the victory of 
        candidate x or y, but with &quot;the election&quot; itself-no matter who 
        wins. From the psychological point of view, at least, that revolution 
        has already begun: the ideological uniformity, once accepted as the normal 
        state of the democratic politics, is enough to virtually outlaw, as &quot;right 
        wing extremism&quot;, any word henceforth said in favor of liberal capitalism, 
        of the USA or of Israel. Who says it receives regular death threats, no 
        longer with the precaution of delivery as anonymous messages: they are 
        to be seen on internet sites and cause no scandal. Dr. Boff is right: 
        Sowing has already been done. It is harvest time. But all this certainly
