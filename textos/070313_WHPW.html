            <p class="style5">(<strong><em>From the Banks of the Potomac</em></strong>) Today we  bring you Part II of III in this series with Dr. Olavo de Carvalho, but  our correspondent wants to remain anonymous. We thought we could  release the entire interview in two parts, but upon review, we decided  it was best to break it down into three segments.</p>
            <p class="style5"> Today, we are  publishing details on the several legal attacks on Carvalho, his work,  and that of the Brazilian conservative movement. Read Part I, <a href="http://westernhemispherepolicywatch.blogspot.com/2007/03/whpw-exclusive-leading-brazilian.html">here</a>. We especially note this comment about the U.S.: "<em>They  [Americans] don't understand how easy it is to use capitalist success  to feed the power of communist and pro-communist organizations. This is  really what Lula is doing. They are not acquainted with Lula's deep and  unflinching loyalty to the organizations that have been supporting him  all along his political career</em>."</p>
            <p class="style5">For authentication purposes, we have asked Dr. Carvalho to link our posts to his site, <a href="/textos/070312_WHPW.html">here</a> (we know there are a few of you out here in town who will undoubtedly  e-mail us for some confirmation that it was, indeed, Carvalho's text  below).</p>
            <p class="style5">In Part III and final segment of this interview,  Carvalho will detail some interesting facts about certain pro-leftist  officials in Brazil's military.</p>
            <p class="style5">Let us know what you think, HMJ.</p>
            <p align="center" class="style5">***</p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>WHPW: Tell our readers a little more about the law suit against you.</strong></p>
            <p class="style5"><strong>OC</strong>: <em>There  are really four suits. The first one was filed by the federal  prosecutor itself, soon after I had published in O Globo an article  called &ldquo;Drink, Mr. President.&rdquo; It was really not an aggressive article.  In it I stated that I didn&rsquo;t know if the New York Times correspondent  Harry Rother was right in calling Lula a drunk, but that if I were Lula  I would drink a lot in order to avoid facing his disgusting situation.</em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>On  one hand he [Lula] had promised to put an end to criminal violence, on  the other he had signed a solemn commitment to support the FARC, the  Colombian narcoguerrillas who were among the main culprits of violence  in Brazil. Isn't it a good reason to get drunk?</em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>The  suit was filed by the attorney-general office in november 2004, under  the number 2004.51.60.017221-4 in the city of Sao Paolo do Meriti, Rio  de Janeiro, where the main office of O Globo is located. But as I moved  to the U.S. in May 2005 (I didn't know about the suit then), the  subpoena didn't reach me in due time. When the judicial agents at last  found my address here, it was too late. The suit became void in  november 2006.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><span class="style5"><strong></strong></span><strong>WHPW: What about the other law suits?</strong></p>
            <p class="style5"><strong>OC</strong>: <em>The second suit is Case n. 583.00.2006.138856-6 of the 1st Court of Sao Paulo. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>In  an article published in Madia Sem Ma&iexcl;scara (Media Unmasked), our  columnist Ipojuca Pontes demonstrated how Roberto Teixeira, a close  friend to President Lula and godfather of one of his sons, used his  influence to raise public money from many cities governed by the  Worker's Party (PT, Partido dos Trabalhadores, Brazil's governing  party).</em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>According to several investigations,  the money wasn't registered in PT's bookeeping and presumably had been  used to consolidate the party's political power in Brazil. Though the  case was published by several newspapers, Mr. Teixeira chose to file a  lawsuit selectively only against our columnist, demanding him to pay  compensation for moral damage. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>The third case was a  judicial order (I don't have the number and date here) filed by the  federal representative Lula Eduardo Greenhalgh against my electronic  newspaper to remove from our website some articles he didn't like.</em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>Mr.  Greenhalgh was acting as a lawyer for some Worker's Party politicians  who were accused of corruption. One of them was accused also of being  an accomplice in the murder of the mayor if the city of Santo Andre,  Celso Daniel, himself a WP's militant but an honest man who was  collecting evidences in order to denounce his corrupt colleagues.</em> <em>As  Daniel was a homosexual, the respondents tried to explore this in order  to dismiss the case as a crime of passion. But soon afterwards no less  than six witnesses for the prosecution were also assassinated, as well  as the coroner that had examined Daniel's corpse. </em></p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>WHPW: What happened next?</strong></p>
            <p class="style5"><strong>OC</strong>: <em>A  little later a police wiretap surprised Mr. Greenhalgh telling the  presidential spokesman Gilberto Carvalho (no relation to me) that they  should try to manoeuver someway the next witness, Celso Daniel's  brother Francisco Daniel, in order to stop him from telling the court,  as he intended to do, that the case was a political murder planned by  the Worker's Party to shut up a man who knew too much.</em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>The  conversation itself was strong evidence that Francisco Daniel was  right. Madia Sem Ma&iexcl;scara reported this news, but every newspaper in  Brazil was reported on it. So why did Mr Greenhalgh chose to sue only  us? </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>As M&iacute;dia Sem M&aacute;scara is the only  overtly conservative and anticommunist media in Brazil, and a very  small and defenseless one at that, the political discrimination is  evident. Significantly enough, the same article (written by me) that  allegedly motivated Mr. Greenhalgh's complaint was published  simultaneosly by MSM and by the Diario do Comercio(Business Daily), the  newspaper belonging to the Sao Paulo Chamber of Commerce, but Mr.  Greenhalgh sued only MSM, not the Diario.</em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>Of course. He  is not crazy. It's easier to fight a dozen penniless conservative  writers than a bunch of the business big shots in Sao Paulo. Luiz  Eduardo Greenhalg used a subpoena to warn my electronic newspaper to  avoid publishing stories on his political activism as, for example, his  appeal for a violent toppling of the 1988 Constitutional Government and  for the dissolution of the Brazilian Army.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>WHPW:  Tell us about the last suit. This one really appears interesting,  especially how it indirectly, and not so indirectly, impacts many good  officials in the Brazilian military.</strong></p>
            <p class="style5"><strong>OC</strong>: <em>The  fourth suit is the most original of all. The case is number  2007.800.005199-2, filed at the 17th Special Court of Rio de Janeiro. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>One  of the main propaganda topics of the Brazilian Left is to demoralize  the military as responsible for violence and tortures practiced against  leftist militants during the Brazilian dictatorship (1964-1984). Some  of the accusations are genuine, but many are very controversial. All of  them, however, are officially accepted as the final truth as soon as  they are published by the media. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>The news is  then used as evidence in claim for federal compensations for the  self-proclaimed victims of the repressive state, most of them former  terrorists, while the victims of their terrorist acts, and their  families, receive nothing at all and are seldom if ever mentioned by  the media. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>Among the military officers  accused of torture is Coronel Alberto Brilhante Ustra (this sounds  Brill-yantee Oostra). For years he has been trying to defend himself,  but the media was not paying attention to him, only to his accusers. He  then wrote a book, A Verdade Sufocada (A Suffocated Truth), to tell his  version of the facts. Suprisingly enough, the book was an astounding  success.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>WHPW: Tell us some more about the book and what has happened since.</strong></p>
            <p class="style5"><strong>OC</strong>: <em>At  first reluctantly, bit by bit the big booksellers started to sell it  and now you can find it everywhere in Brazil. It happened that, Colonel  Ustra's website, </em><a href="javascript:ol("><em>www.averdadesufocada.com</em></a><em>,  mistakingly quoted as a favorable reviewer of the book a lawyer and  journalist, Adilson Marcos da Silva, who was instead one the the real  characters of the story. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>Mr. Marcos, a rabid  leftist and anti-Antiamerican trumpeter, got angry with the Colonel and  reasonably so, but decided to take revenge against an innocent: my  editor, partner and representative in Brazil, Edson Oliveira. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>First,  Mr. Marcos arbitrarily picked six bookshops among the hundreds that  were selling the book, and then he sued Mr. Oliveira as being  responsible for all of them, which he is not. Mr. Oliveira owns only  one bookshop and publishing house, he is not the publisher of Colonel  Ustra's book and he cannot be held responsible for a mistake committed  by the Colonel. If he is now summoned to pay compensations to Mr.  Marcos, his real guilt lies elsewhere: the main item in his catalogue  are my books and the DVDs of my lectures, most of them recorded at the  company's auditorium.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><strong>WHPW: What do you expect to be the outcome?</strong></p>
            <p class="style5"><strong>OC</strong>: <em>It's  impossible to say. Anything can happen. The judicial system in Brazil  is changing very fast due to political interference. Many of the old  judges have been replaced by political activists affiliated to a  movement called alternative Law, which overtly professes to judge rule  to the ideological meaning of each case and not the written Law. </em></p>
            <p class="style5"><em>If  the cases are brought to normal judges, everything will be OK. But if  we fall into the claws of alternative Law judges, we are lost. As  judges for for each case are chosen at random, it all depends on luck. </em></p>
            <p class="style5 style1"><strong>WHPW: Why does Lula tolerate these matters and people</strong></p>
            <p class="style5"><strong>OC</strong>: <em>Mr.  Teixeira and Mr. Greenhalgh are his old friends and correligionists. He  would never leave them unassisted. People here in the U.S. are easily  impressed by the Brazilian governmen's political economy, which is  really pro-capitalism. They don't understand how easy it is to use  capitalist success to feed the power of communist and pro-communist  organizations. This is really what Lula is doing. They are not  acquainted with Lula's deep and unflinching loyalty to the  organizations that have been supporting him all along his political  career.</em></p>
