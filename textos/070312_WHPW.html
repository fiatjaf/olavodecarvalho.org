A  entrevistadora quis permanecer an&ocirc;nima, mas agrade&ccedil;o a ela a ajuda inestim&aacute;vel  que prestou &agrave; divulga&ccedil;&atilde;o de fatos que a grande m&iacute;dia, brasileira ou americana,  teima em ignorar. &ndash; O. de C.</strong></em></p>
            <hr size=1>
            <p>              Olavo de Carvalho, 59, is a Brazilian  writer and philosopher presently living in the U.S. as a foreign correspondent for Brazilian newspapers.</p>
            <p> In an exclusive interview for Western Hemisphere Policy Watch (WHPW), the  former university lecturer on Political Philosophy in Sao Paulo,  Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba, discusses a wide-array of topics, the most perplexing  of which is the legal battle being waged by Brazilian communists against <a href="http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/">him and his  works</a>.</p>
            <p>Carvalho is the author of a dozen books and a widely read weekly columnist in  Brazilian press. He also was a fan and supporter of former Reagan  Administration official, the late <a href="http://westernhemispherepolicywatch.blogspot.com/2006/11/ecuador-western-hemisphere-anti.html">Dr. Constantine Menges</a> &ndash; a favorite of WHPW  Editors. We would like to publicly thank folks who made this possible, but our  correspondent wants to remain anonymous.</p>
            <p> Given the length of the interview, we shall run it in two parts. Today,  Carvalho (ODC) generally dicusses the state of Brazilian media and freedom of  speech. What he says will surprise you. The second part of the interview  discussing his personal battle against Brazilian state censorship against  conservative view points shall be run later this week.</p>
            <p> Let us know what you think, HMJ.</p>
            <p align="center">***</p>
            <p><span class="style1"><strong>WHPW: What is the status of free and  open media in Brazil today?</strong></span></p>
            <p>  ODC: <em>There is no official censorship in Brazil because there is no real need for it. Since the 1960s  the Left launched a huge campaign to occupy all the spaces and to dislodge its  enemies from news offices in Brazilian newspapers and TV channels</em>.</p>
            <p>  <em>There  are virtually no conservatives in the Brazilian media. The few remaining ones  keep their mouths shut not to lose their jobs. The political debate in  Brazilian newspapers and TV channels takes place only between different leftist  groups. </em></p>
            <p><em>Even  in the Parliament, most of what is today called the &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; is constituted  only by social-democrats, a moderate leftwing party. The so-called &ldquo;rightwing  party&rdquo; &ndash; the PFL (Party of the Liberal Front) &ndash; defines itself in the tradition  of the American Democratic Party. </em></p>
            <p><em>There  is no Brazilian equivalent to the GOP or to the British Conservative Party. Can  you imagine a democracy where the only active forces were the Democratic Party  and the Communist Party? This is Brazil.</em></p>
            <p><span class="style1">  WHPW: Why is the media manipulated?  Who is responsible for manipulating media today?</span></p>
            <p>  ODC: <em>&ldquo;&hellip; most of the media are awfully indebted to the  official banks. The government uses its financial power to intimidate and to  control the press. But it finds no difficulty to do so, for the companies  themselves are willfully submissive. Even when they criticize the government,  they do so only in minor details, avoiding any mention to the Sao Paulo Forum or Brazilian President Lula da Silva&rsquo;s links to  the Colombian narco-guerillas.</em></p>
            <p><em> Everybody knows that Mr. Boris Casoy, the successful  anchor of Bandeirantes TV Channel, who mentioned the forbidden matters in his  TV commentaries, was fired under government pressure. As for myself, I lost my  jobs in three newspapers and one weekly magazine because of my insistence in  denouncing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo">Sao Paulo Forum</a>. </em></p>
            <p><em>In cultural matters, the leftist hegemony is so extended  that even the few media that are hostile to the government, like the weekly  magazine Veja, are supportive of the left in every moral or religious  controversy, besides flattering the leftist intellectuals and boycotting the  conservative ones.</em></p>
            <p class="style1"><strong><em>WHPW: What will it take to help Brazilians not feel so afraid and  overcome by state-controls?</em></strong></p>
            <p>
              ODC: <em>If only the American media told Americans what is  really going on in Brazil, everything would be easier for us.</em></p>
            <p>
              <em>But  American journalists seem to look at the facts only from the economic side.  They see Lula running a capitalist economy and they conclude that he is America&rsquo;s friend. But there is no substantial contradiction  between running a capitalist economy while draining its energies to feed a  growing communist movement and to support the arrangements for a continental  &quot;war of the whole people&quot; against the USA, as planned by Hugo Chavez. </em></p>
            <p><em>Lula's  government can be defined, alas, by that two-headed strategy wisely grounded on  the mutual independence between economy and conspiracy. Many Brazilian  businessmen let themselves to be guided by the big media, both Brazilian and  American. As they find no news about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo">Sao Paulo Forum </a>in  the big newspapers from both Brazil and USA, they will never understand the real state of affairs in  Brazil. </em></p>
            <p><em>Only in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo  a large part of the businessmen are acquainted to the facts, owing to the Sao Paulo Chamber of Commerce, a brave conservative organization  lead by the former presidential candidate Guilherme Afif Domingos. In every  other Brazilian state the businessmen are quite mistaken about the government&rsquo;s  political alliances with the continental Left.</em> </p>
