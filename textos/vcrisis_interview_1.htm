            21.11.05 | Recently I had the chance to spend some time with an
            extraordinary individual. Of Brazilian origin, this university
            professor, thinker, philosopher and self-made investigative
            journalist revealed a wholly unknown reality -for me at least-
            vis-a-vis the nature of the Sao Paolo Forum; its members and its
            carefully orchestrated political goals. Often one tends to incur in
            the mistake of judging situations isolatedly, which, according to
            <a href="http://www.olavodecarvalho.org">Olavo de Carvalho </a>,
            shows not only ignorance but naivete. Aghast with the wealth of
            knowledge that Olavo commands on Brazilian and regional politics, I
            intended to unravel through a series of questions the reasons behind
            the emergence of 'leftist' movements and leaders across Latin
            America. Olavo's take is factual, radical and very much detached
            from the usual nonsense that one encounters in the mainstream media.
            Hopefully readers of this site will find his opinions illuminating,
            as I did.

              >- Olavo, you contend that the neocommunist surge in Latin America
              is not a spontaneous phenomena but rather the result of the
              successful implementation of strategies devised by Antonio
              Gramsci. Could you please expand into the philosophical/political
              underpinnings of Gramsci's methodology?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Gramsci, side by side with the frankfurtians and the Hungarian
            philosopher Georg Lukacs, is one of the top masterminds of the
            so-called �cultural marxism�, which is not a school of thought but a
            bunch of heterogeneous proposals having in common the hate to
            Western civilization, and the belief that, the cultural war against
            it, should precede and guide the political fight for socialism.
            Somewhat cultural marxism is at the same time the apex of marxism
            and its nemesis. On the one hand, it delivers the marxist thought
            from the chains of soviet mediocre orthodoxy and provides it with a
            considerable amount of intellectual sophistication; on the other, it
            destroys from the inside the marxist doctrine of history,
            emphasizing the primacy of cultural factors over the economic ones.
            Economic arguments that occasionaly drop from the mouths of cultural
            marxists are but lip service they pay to communist tradition, but in
            the final practical account their inner belief is that �ideas have
            consequences�. They try to accomplish the practical goals of marxism
            by means that disavow its theory.
          </p>
          <p>
            But while the aforementioned authors focused mainly in theoretical
            issues, Gramsci, who was the founder and leader of the Italian
            Communist Party, was interested above all in practical results. He
            created the strategy and the tactics of the �cultural revolution�
            that should pave the way for the seizure of State power by the
            communists. The cultural revolution should be a subtle and almost
            imperceptible transformation of the collective mind, intented to
            induce everybody to think, to feel and to act according to the
            tenets of socialism without being consciously socialists. Socialist
            symbols and values under some other name should be inocculated in
            the souls of people since early age. Disguised socialist influence
            should spread to every field of human social existence, including
            private life and the most intimate feelings. Child care, medicine,
            psychoterapy, religion and marriage counseling were preferential
            channels for the transmission of that influence. Christian churches,
            for instance, should not be criticized, but infiltrated in order to
            deprive them of their spiritual content and use them as megaphones
            for communist watchwords. At the same time, disguised communists
            should occupy all the posts in educational, cultural and media
            organizations, gradually and carefully expelling their opponents to
            the last man. Communist ideology should recast all the language of
            public conversations, in order to provide that every circulating
            opinion contributes unconsciously to communist-fabricated general
            results.
          </p>
          <p>
            The perverted character of the whole scheme is clearly psychopatic,
            but so much dangerous at that. Gramsci was an admirer of Machiavelli
            and he believed that the Communist Party should be �The New Prince�,
            ruling over the whole of society �with the invisible and omnipresent
            authority of a categoric imperative, of a divine commandment� (sic).
            Only after acquiring such amount of psychological mastership over
            society should the Party try to conquer the State, at a time when
            the very possibility of finding some serious resistence was already
            eliminated.

              free markets values in the region is but the unconscious resultant
              of Gramsci's plan?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course. The cultural changes affect everyone far beyond the focus
            of its political beliefs. One may remain a conservative in politics
            while making so many little concessions in one's language, in one's
            morals, in one's general cultural outlook, that one's conservatism
            looses its emotional strenght and its capacity to fight. You may
            verify it yourself: while communists are free to preach today the
            same things they preached thirty years ago, with the only difference
            that they receive ever warmer welcomes in any elegant environment,
            conservatives that remain faithful to the ideals of Robert Taft or
            Barry Goldwater are blamed as extremists even by their fellow
            conservatives.

              >- To what extent Gramsci's theories resemble those of dictator
              Fidel Castro?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Fidel Castro comes from a different ideological background. He
            followed the old leninist strategy of the armed vanguard that seizes
            power by violence and creates a new society from the top. Only when
            he hit his head against the wall of limits opposed to the armed
            revolutionary spreading, in the 70's, he had the joyful surprise to
            be informed that many of his fellows from other Communist parties in
            Latin America were already high in the practice of a new and smarter
            revolutionary technique. The defeat of the guerrillas was
            immediately followed by the general adoption of the Gramscian long
            term strategy, that obviously didn't renounce to the use of violence
            but postponed it to a far better occasion. Castro welcomed the new
            strategy and adapted to it very efficiently. He managed to stop the
            guerrilla fighting and to make up Latin America communist parties to
            work along Gramscian guidelines. The reflux of the guerrilla
            movement was celebrated by almost every non-communist politician,
            journalist and businessman in Latin America as a sign of the �death
            of communism�. This mistake was due to the fact that these people
            cared only for the visible surface of political, military and
            economic facts, giving little or no attention to deep and large
            scale transformations in the social and cultural background that was
            precisely the chosen field for the expansion of communist activity
            at that time.
