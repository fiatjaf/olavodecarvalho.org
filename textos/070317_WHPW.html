            <p class="style5"> <strong><em>(From the Banks of the Potomac)</em></strong> Today we bring the final part of our discussion with Dr. Olavo de Carvalho. Parts I and II are available <a href="http://westernhemispherepolicywatch.blogspot.com/2007/03/whpw-exclusive-leading-brazilian_13.html">here </a>. <br>
              <br>
As with Parts I and II, for authentication purposes, we have asked Dr. Carvalho to link our posts to his site, <a href="http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/textos/070312_WHPW.html">here </a> (we know there are a few of you out here in town who will undoubtedly e-mail us for some confirmation that it was, indeed, Carvalho's text below). <br>
<br>
The legal system and the military are some of the few institutions that the Left will have a tough time taking over in Latin America. We plan to expand our discussions with Dr. Carvalho in the future about this last item discussed in the interview. The Left is attempting to pollute the military with leftist thinkers and, as you will read below, such individuals will even threaten others with death to get their way. <br>
<br>
We want to publicly thank Dr. Olavo de Carvalho, and our other supporters and readers that made this interview possible. Freedom in the Americas is key to our future. We must continue to support the conservative movement boldly, no matter where in the Western Hemisphere. <br>
<br>

            <p align="left" class="style5">              <span class="style1"><strong>WHPW: Finally, tell our readers a little about the military fellow who is angry at you and what he says and what is trying to do. </strong></span><br>
              <br>
              <strong>OC:</strong> <em>It's a whole bunch of military officers, generals and colonels of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, that have been for years making anti-American propaganda in military academies and magazines, under the pretext that there were many illegal Americans in the Amazon. These Americans, they said, were agents working for the American government to prepare a future occupation of that area by the American armed forces.</em> <br>
              <br>
              <span class="style1"><strong>WHPW: Did they get upset with the articles? </strong></span><br>
              <br>
              <strong>OC:</strong> <em>When I wrote articles explaining to the officers that those Americans did not work for the American government but for the UN and its associated NGOs, and even to some overtly anti-American organizations like the World Council of Churches, they got very angry with me, refused to discuss the matter rationally and chose instead to say that I was in the CIA payroll. I answered them with a few four-letter-words and the matter was soon forgotten. </em><br>
              <br>
              <span class="style1"><strong>WHPW: Was that the end of it? </strong></span><strong><br>
              <br>
              OC:</strong><em> Later I wrote a new article, now asking them why didn't they profit from their popularity with the Left in order to say something on behalf of the families of soldiers killed by terrorists, who suffer poverty and humiliation while the terrorists themselves receive generous reparation from the federal government for having been arrested and allegedly tortured during the military dictatorship. <br>
              <br>
              Now they got really angry. One of them, General Durval de Andrade Nery, threatened to kill me if I tried to contact him, while others pressured a valiant military newspaper from Minas Gerais, run by my friend Colonel Miguez, not to publish my articles anymore.</em></p>
