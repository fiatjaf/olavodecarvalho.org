          <p><strong>What is to be a philosopher? </strong></p>
          <p>
            It is to firmly believe in human capacity to understand reality
            &#8211; and to bet one&#8217;s life in this belief. The apotheosis
            of reason begins with an act of faith. Hegel already said that:
            without faith in the power of the spirit, no philosophical
            investigation. Philosophy, like the Kingdom of Heaven, was not made
            for the timid and recalcitrant. But to this first bet there follows
            a commitment, which is the one of never ignoring anything of the
            reality on purpose. The philosopher has to open himself entirely to
            the variety of facts that present themselves, without taking refuge
            on premature explanations. Instead of inventing explanations, he has
            to wait until reality suggests and proves them, even if, during this
            wait, he risks going almost insane in the confusion of data. That is
            why I do not like to call philosophers &#8220;thinkers&#8221;.
            Thinking is easy. What is hard is to think things as they are
            &#8211; and to do this it is needed, many times, to go against our
            own thought, make it go where it does not want to go. That is why,
            also, I do not see substantial difference between philosophy and
            science. The sciences are only provisory stabilizations of certain
            philosophical investigations, for which was found a consensual
            method that can be uniformly practiced by a whole community, but
            that, from time to time, are dissolved again in the sea of deep
            philosophical questioning.

            Disastrous, though less than one would expect. Journals like
            &quot;<em>Presen&ccedil;a Filos&oacute;fica</em>&quot;
            (Philosophical Presence), &quot;<em
              >Revista Brasileira de Filosofia</em
            >&quot; (Brazilian Journal on Philosophy), and
            &quot;<em>S&iacute;ntese</em>&quot; (Synthesis) from Belo Horizonte,
            which I do not know if is still in print, save our honor. But, in
            general, what one sees is the basest ideological rubbish dominating
            the scenery. Just an example: the almost instinctive capacity to
            distinguish between a concept and a figure of speech is the mark of
            talent for philosophical studies, the initial condition for entering
            philosophy. Our most renowned academic philosophers, after decades
            of study, have not yet acquired this elementary skill. They only
            occupy themselves with spreading among the students the confusion
            and obscurity of their crude souls, and compensate their interior
            misery through the exhibitionist participation in political
            campaigns. The worst part is the new fashion of philosophy for kids,
            to produce jobs for academe and to abuse childish innocence:
            philosophy is not a thing for kids, as supposes our execrable
            Ministry of Education. Alchemically speaking, philosophy is the
            brimstone that crystallizes mercury, the volatile mind, to produce
            salt &#8211; the perfect mind. Premature crystallization is an
            alchemical disaster, the congealing of the soul. Philosophy teachers
            are helping our children to suffocate their authentic perceptions
            under a pseudo-intellectual discourse of despairing superficiality.

          </p>
          <p>
            These things always come together, or they do not come at all. The
            founder of philosophical tradition, Socrates, was a synthesis of the
            three. Plato was not to be left behind. And even the writings that
            were left of Aristotle, mere technical drafts for class lecturing,
            let us see the fine sense of humor that certainly animated his
            conversations with the students.

              >Can your reinterpretation of Aristotle lead us to a unified view

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sincerely, I hope so. Aristotle was very aware of his position in
            the evolutionary scheme of the philosophy before him. All his
            thinking is not only a reflection on this evolution, but almost a
            materialization of it under the form of order and system &#8211;
            like when you hear a melody and suddenly perceive this temporal
            sequence in the form of a drawing, of a graphic: time that becomes
            space. First the Greeks knew the mythological-poetical discourse of
            epics and poetry, after that the rhetoric discourse of the Sophists,
            and after that the dialectics of Socrates and Plato, and finally the
            logical structure revealed by Aristotle. This historical sequence is
            identical to the internal structure of the system of Aristotle, such
            as I believe I have revealed in the &quot;theory of four
            discourses&quot;. This phenomenon of a system that has consciously
            made and remade the historical evolution is a great miracle of the
            spirit. Some Islamic mystics consider Aristotle a prophet, and I
            think they are right.

              there, your contact with writers and universities of that country?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Romania today is my second country. I have as many friends there as
            in Brazil, and no enemy except the cold. I also have good friends
            among the Romanians that live here in Brazil, such as Gheorghe
            Legmann, valiant fighter for Brazil-Romania relations. The Romanians
            are a very cultured people, with the soul refined through suffering.
            The number of wise men &quot;per capita&quot; there is impressive.
            It is also a breathtakingly beautiful country, the greatest natural
            reserve of Europe, with forests full of bears and wolves that never
            heard of ecological crisis or of Greenpeace. But the neighboring
            countries did not give Romania the least chance. They invaded her
            and pillaged her all they wanted, and imposed on her the
            straightjacket of totalitarian regimes, first Nazism and after that
            forty years of communism. Today the Romanians, deprived by the New
            World Order, are a tired, worn out, unbelieving people, with
            difficulty to see their own more obvious qualities. However, in the
            midst of the blackest poverty, they do not lose the love of
            studying. They are an example for Brazilians, which only admit study
            as a means of finding a job or making party conversation wittier.
            The Romanians love Brazil (they even gave the name Copacabana to a
            beach on the Black Sea, and the anthem of the Romanian national
            soccer team is a samba), and our presence there does them good.
            Maybe no one has done more to improve the self-image of the
            Romanians than the Brazilian ambassador, Jer&ocirc;nimo Moscardo,
            today a veritable &quot;pop star&quot; in Bucharest. I think every
            Brazilian should spend some time there, to see what dignity in
            misery is and to stop complaining so much. Bucharest is the poorest
            capital in Europe &#8211; and the most peaceful. There simply are no
            armed robberies. When I return to this country of ours, where a
            whole broiled chicken costs only two dollars, I am perplexed at this
            middle class so chubby and so rebellious. They complain so much
            about life, and justify violence through &#8220;misery&#8221;: I
            wish those people would go see the thousands of street children in
            Bucharest. They have to hide on the sewers during winter, and come
            beg us for food in English, French, and German, with an air of
            innocence that day by day disappears from the eyes of our children,
            corrupted by false educators.

          </p>
          <p>
            Cioran cannot be read literally, or else you will blow your brains
            out. That is something he himself did not do, what shows us he was
            aware of the dose of irony in his writings (he used to say he was a
            fraud and that people would see that if they understood him). Cioran
            takes the stand in the name of the devil, prosecutor of humanity,
            and defies us to take charge of the defense. Playing among patent
            truths and truthlike exaggeration, he always leaves us an opening
            for salvation, and it is precisely in these hiatuses, in these
            calculated failings inside his argument, that lies the most
            intelligent part of his work, in truth more pedagogic or
            psycho-therapeutic than philosophical. Cioran can induce you to
            despair, to stoic resignation, or to resuming faith and hope. He can
            be poison or medication: it is up to you to decide.

          <p><strong>Do you get along well with the computer? </strong></p>
          <p>
            Wonderfully well. It was affinity at first sight. Actually, I think
            I would never have published any books if I had no computer: it was
            this machine, and only it, that allowed me to put in order writings
            accumulated during twenty years. And today Internet is my main
            medium of information.

          <p>
            When you write only for a circle of students, like I did for a long
            time, you have a tendency to create a style that is compacted, full
            of abbreviations and things left unsaid, that in the end becomes a
            hermetic thing; or else something that multiplies explanations, with
            minutiae and pedagogic details that lengthen it overmuch. To return
            to regular journalism was healthy discipline, that forced on me
            daily exercises to conciliate what Horatio thought impossible to do
            so: brevity and clarity. On the other hand, this also gave me the
            opportunity to circulate ideas that I have been &#8220;brooding
            over&#8221; in solitude along twenty years, and that seem to me can
            be useful to Brazil.

          <p>
            I think that Brazil is going through its most difficult and decisive
            moment in its history. We have the dream of being a nation and have
            the right to be, but at the moment when we are just about to realize
            this dream, nations are not in fashion any more and world government
            approaches with giant steps. Our challenge is to prove we are
            capable of representing the superior ideals of humanity better than
            the world government. But, to do that, we need three things: to
            rapidly absorb the spiritual legacy of all civilizations, to learn
            to avoid the stereotyped ideological alternatives with which this
            world strategy divides us, and overcome a false native nationalism,
            full of complexes and debilitating, that is today easily manipulated
            by the left wing sold to the New World Order. We have to create a
            new nationalism, capable of competing in the world market. I usually
            call it national-liberalism, with the explanation that it is not an
            ideological system, but only a provisory arrangement, a Brazilian
            improvisation of a solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The greatest obstacles are the intellectuals, strongly attached to
            absurd ideological schemes, to antimilitary resentments that are
            very well used (and well paid for) by this world strategy to weaken
            us, and to personal hates unexplained logically, such as this feud
            against Roberto Campos, a man that, in the field of actions, and not
            in the field of bla-bla-bla, did more for Brazil than all the Left
            united. The only way to persuade this people, is to have the
            patience of Ant&ocirc;nio Olinto.
