            There's no other place in which the threads of the world's
            revolutionary net show up as clearly as in Latin America. However,
            they are only visible to those observers who, jumping over the heavy
            camouflage laid over the facts by an accomplice media, have the guts
            and the capacity to research by themselves, making use of resources
            from the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            On that matter, the most important, most revealing piece of news to
            appear lately was suppressed, like a thousand others, from the
            Brazilian media: Venezuelan president Hugo Ch&aacute;vez sent
            Al-Qaeda a million dollars a few days after September 11, 2001.
          </p>
          <p>
            The information comes from the most trustworthy of all sources: the
            man in charge of the operation, Juan Diaz Castillo, an officer of
            the Venezuelan Air Force and, at the time, the pilot of Hugo
            Ch&aacute;vez's presidential aircraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            A confession in full detail can be found in the website of the
            Venezuelan Military officers opposing Ch&aacute;vez,
            <a
              href="http://militaresdemocraticos.surebase.com/articulos/en/20021231-01.html%20"
              >http://militaresdemocraticos.surebase.com/articulos/en/20021231-01.html </a
            >I do not ask you, dear readers, to believe in me. Go to the
            website. Check it out. Eliminate your doubts writing directly to
            Castillo. His e-mail address is
            <a href="../semana/aguila@militaresdemocraticos.com"

            I wrote him and he confirmed everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same website informs that Islamic terrorists and agents of the
            DGI (Direcci&oacute;n General de Inteligencia&#151;General
            Intelligence Directorate), the Cuban secret police, hold decisive
            positions in the structure created by Ch&aacute;vez to suffocate the
            national strike that threatens to throw him out.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arrogance of Brazil's leftist journalists makes them believe it
            is OK to deny the readers news of such importance, so that you may
            remain etherized in the pinky illusion of a moment of collective
            insanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            But not only on that side is the illusion beginning to fade, even if
            the new government is still in its first days. The appointment of
            Mr. Luiz Eduardo Soares for National Secretary of Public Security is
            enough to show what kind of 'war on crime' can be expected from
            federal authorities in the next years. If you don't know Mr. Soares,
            you don't know what you are missing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intellectually, as I have demonstrated in 'The Collective Imbecile
            II', he is someone who sticks political labels on people about whom
            he ignores everything, who pontificates on subjects he doesn't
            understand and who affects erudition quoting authors he has not
            read. He is the typical Latin American pseudo-intellectual, a mind
            so empty of culture as it is full of moralizing platitudes against
            the evils of capitalism. Nobody could represent the new government's
            mentality better than him.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the moral side, he is even more interesting. If you do not
            remember, he is that sub-secretary of security from Rio de Janeiro
            who, knowing the whereabouts of the drug lord and murderer Marcinho
            VP, sought by the police at the time, and knowing that the criminal
            had the financial support of filmmaker Jo&atilde;o Moreira Sales,
            actively hid that from the authorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Soares did not explain why he did that. He just threw
            accusations against the &quot;rotten side&quot; of the police as if
            the rottenness of something could serve as a justification for the
            rottenness of something else and went to the US, where he found the
            opportunity to shine in one of those universities filled with
            friends of international terrorism as the hero of a cause which, in
            his imagination, couldn't be more noble.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrasting with Mr. Soares's silence, Mr. Sales decided to talk.
            According to him, Marcinho VP deserved help because he had the most
            respectable aspiration of going to Mexico to do some guerrilla
            training with the Zapatistas and the police confirmed later that he
            actually went there.
          </p>
          <p>
            A similar pretext was used by the members of the leftist elite who
            protected the kidnappers of millionaire Ab&iacute;lio Diniz. As soon
            as the secret that these were armed agents of the Chilean Communist
            Party came to light, those wonderful people immediately covered the
            compromising liaison, in a sudden display of contempt for their
            former prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, under the allegation that these were
            just regular criminals, unfaithful to the Party, who killed and
            kidnapped for money and not for a cause. Truly an inverted
            camouflage, for it showed the intention of imposing on the public,
            above the respect for the law, a new scale of values in which crimes
            are not so bad if the ideology of its beneficiaries is right.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, if that moral option was in the eyes of Jo&atilde;o Moreira
            Sales the intimate justification for the occultation of a criminal,
            what other reason could there be, in the eyes of Mr. Soares, for the
            occultation of the occultation?
          </p>
          <p>
            There are only three hypotheses. One, disregard and accommodation:
            Mr. Soares, as acting sub-secretary of security, thought that a
            fleeing criminal was none of his business. Two, some egotistic
            motive: money, to help a friend, the exchange of favors. Third, an
            ideological option: Mr. Soares believed that the transformation of a
            regular thug in a terrorist and guerrilla-fighter was a moral
            enterprise of high value to which he should lend a hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Soares would find the first two hypotheses an abomination. Being
            a man of manners, a so-called 'intellectual', he would never do
            anything as vulgar as protecting a 'regular thug', which deserves
            only the despise of a conscious revolutionary. So, what he finds
            worthy of protection is the criminal who has been indoctrinated,
            trained and armed to kill for a political cause which is the same as
            his. What a coincidence that the Zapatistas, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez,
            Fidel Castro and the FARC all share the same cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            The presence of Mr. Soares as National Secretary of Public Security
            is therefore a promise that the good days of vulgar criminality are
            over: all criminals without ideology belong in jail. I dare not ask
            where the others do belong. Mexico, perhaps? I don't think so. Who
            would go so far when training can be obtained at home, with FARC
            specialists hired to elevate the technical level of violence in the
            slums of Rio?
          </p>
