      <p align="left">The coincidence of Christmas and the Muslim Eid-al-Fitr 
        (end of fasting) is an occasion to remember that the contact points between 
        the Christian and Islamic religions &#8211; and Judaism as well &#8211; 
        go far beyond what the goodie-two-shoes ecumenical formulas may suggest. 
      </p>
      <p>If there is a definite lesson to be gotten from the study of compared 
        religions is that they are incomparable: they are not varieties of the 
        same genre, which can be evaluated one for the other. They are irreducible 
        manifestations &#8211; and irreducibly diverse &#8211; of a supra-human 
        intellectual light that, falling over different objects, produces different 
        refractions. The comparison, in this case, can only take two directions: 
        either the sterile confrontation of what cannot be confronted or the simple 
        inspiration that makes us lift our eyes to the common source, whether 
        we imagine it as an unmoving motor or as the eternally silent source of 
        the Word. </p>
      <p>That is why the comparative study of religion, when it takes the form 
        of the confrontation of established doctrines, ends up as a dispute of 
        theologists &#8211; and this kind of discussion, said the prophet Mohammed, 
        undisputedly takes us to hell. Much more fruitful is the approximation 
        of the symbols, that say the same thing in different languages, but in 
        such a way that, when the mind apprehends the communion of sense between 
        them, cannot translate them into a third. Understood as a contemplative 
        discipline, the science of sacred symbols is an introduction to the clarity 
        of the unmentionable. </p>
      <p>Maybe even more significant than the coincidence between Christmas and 
        Eid-al-Fitr would be its approximation with the Laylat-al-Qadr, the night 
        when the Koran &quot;came down&quot; from Heaven into the heart of the 
        prophet. Mohammed is the illiterate that, in the silence of the night, 
        receives through angelic dictation the most beautiful book of the Arabic 
        language, the book that transcends the properties of the idiom to the 
        extent that its recitation out loud affects the animals, that stop to 
        listen to it. It is also at night that the Virgin, made fecund by the 
        Spirit, gives birth to the most noble of human creatures, undistinguished 
        from the Creator himself. The analogy between these two sublime paradoxes 
        is evident. And, while theologists dispute in the dark, weighing Christ 
        against Mohammed, the narrative itself is &quot;light upon light&quot;: 
        Mohammed does not correspond to Christ, but to Mary, the human carrier 
        of the Divine Verb; Christ is not Mohammed, it is the Divine Verb, the 
        Logos, Kalimat&#8217;ullah. </p>
      <p>The spirit blows where it wills, how it wills. It is like the Koran says, 
        &quot;there is in this a sign, for those who understand&quot;. This does 
        not mean that the Pope is wrong when he says that Christianism is the 
        only way to salvation. How could he be wrong, if the concept of &#8220;way 
        to salvation&#8221; itself is not applicable to Islam or Judaism? Judaism 
        is the law, the divine-historical constitution of the chosen people, not 
        the way to salvation for individual souls, for errant sinners and stray 
        sheep. And this word &quot;religion&quot; itself does not correspond to 
        the Arab din, which is thus translated erroneously. Din is the natural 
        and primordial way of being of the social human being, the civil constitution 
        of the sacred society &#8211; something without correspondence in the 
        scriptures, where God speaks to the individual souls, regardless of and 
        indifferent to what belongs to Caesar. </p>
      <p>How, then, to compare these different dimensions, flattening them in 
        the doctrinal confrontation of right and wrong? </p>
      <p>The different religions simply do not speak of the same thing. This needs 
        to be understood so we can be aware that it is the same Voice that speaks 
        through all of them. The conflicts happen caused by human incomprehension, 
        anguished by the vain efforts to reduce to doctrinal unity something that 
        is not doctrine, but the Presence itself. The Koran itself teaches us 
        the limits of these speculations, and warns the Jewish, the Christian, 
        and the Muslims: &quot;Compete in the practice of good, for in the final 
        judgement We will settle thy differences.&quot;</p>
