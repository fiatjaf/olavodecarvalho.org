                >On December 20, 1994, I published the following statement in a
                Rio de Janeiro newspaper: &#8220;Artists and intellectuals are
                one of the richest consumer markets for drugs and do not desire
                to lose their suppliers: when they defend the legalization of
                drugs, they are fighting their own battle. But they are not only
                consumers: they are disseminators through propaganda. If you
                have even a short memory you will remember that, in this
                country, the fashion of drugs in the sixties did not start in
                the lower classes, but in the universities, in drama groups,
                psychologist circles, surrounded by the prestige of a vice that
                was elegant and enlightening.&#8221;

                >The author of these lines was immediately diagnosed as a case
                of acute paranoia and complete social inaptitude. Letters with
                imprecations and asking for my head rained on the newsroom, all
                of them signed by illustrious people.</font

                >Four years later, a document from ONU, emitted just last week,
                confirms that this little fellow was right. The glamorization of
                vice is a formidable advertising support to illegal drug
                dealing. All combat to the international plague of drugs is
                condemned unless we are able, beforehand, to persuade all these
                beautiful little creatures of modern pedantry, intellectuals and
                artists, to control what comes out of their sweet, well-fed
                mouths.</font

                >I am not writing this down to announce my candidacy for
                prophet. I write this down to make known that the
                intellectuality, a class subsidized with money from the people
                &#8211; with the objective of telling this same people what goes
                on in the world &#8211; has almost completely forgotten its
                duty. When one of its members decides to fulfill it on his own,
                the class falls on top of him like a ton o bricks, as if he was
                a criminal, a traitor, an adulterous, a thoroughly bad guy. More
                and more they occupy themselves, on an international scale, with
                hiding the most obvious truths under a mantle of insensate
                speculation and hallucinogenic words. They have become a peril,
                maybe the greatest obstacle to the solution of all the great
                evils that afflict humankind. For intellectuality is the eye of
                the world, and Jesus Christ already said that, if the eye is
                corrupt, the whole body falls to ruin.</font

                >Paul Johnson demonstrated, in a memorable book (Intellectuals,
                1988), that the modern type of intellectual, whose first
                incarnation he locates in Rousseau (he could also have said
                Voltaire, or Diderot), is substantially a consummate liar, an
                egocentric and immoral pervert, incapable of guiding himself
                and, regardless of that, still acts as guide to humanity.

                >In an essay published in 1942, Otto Maria Carpeaux believed to
                find the cause of intellectual perversion in the decadence of
                the universities, scaled down to become professional schools and
                ideology courses: &#8220;The illiterate are always right,
                because they are many and occupy a place of prominence, this
                &#8216;intellectual proletariat&#8217;... They read the books
                and decide on the success of the bookstore, criticize pictures
                and expositions, applaud and boo in the theater and in concerts,
                direct the currents of political ideas, and all of it with the
                authority that the academic degree gives them. In short, they
                perform the role of the <em>&eacute;lite</em>. They are the
                <em>nouveaux maitres</em>, the
                <em>se&ntilde;oritos arrogantes</em>, graduated and violent; and
                we suffer the consequences, bitterly, cruelly.&#8221;</font

                >All of this is true, but not enough to explain the phenomenon,
                that began in the 18th century, and is prior to the fall of
                universities. The fall is the effect, not the cause. It is part
                of the general process of laicization of intellectual life that
                if, on the one hand, had the merit of freeing intelligence from
                the abuse from ecclesiastical authority, on the other hand did
                it by liberating the intellectuals from all moral obligation, by
                giving them, together with a healthy freedom, an excessive and
                unlimited authority. For the eye is the light of the body, but
                has natural limits: the reality around it. The abuse begins when
                the eye, giving up seeing, begins to invent. And this revolution
                does not begin with Voltaire or Rousseau, but with a man no one
                would say was dishonest or perverse. It begins with Immanuel
                Kant. He was the first that, denying our capacity to know
                reality as such, attributed at the same time to human
                intelligence the power to invent a valid world. With this, he
                involuntarily substituted the legitimate intention of knowing
                with an unlimited ambition for power. Observing the modern
                intellectual crap, it is time that someone knocked at the door
                of the impeccable Immanuel Kant and told him the fatidic words
                from that famous Brazilian comic samba:</font
