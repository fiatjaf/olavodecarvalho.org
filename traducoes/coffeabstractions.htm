              One of the most terrible customs that North-American culture
              transmitted to the world is the literal belief in certain
              scientific metaphors that, entering current language, end up
              deforming the perception of reality and perverting all human
              relations.

              Arrested by the apparent credibility of the terms, people acquire
              new patterns of judgement that &#8211; reputed as capable of
              giving them the correct measure of the world &#8211; in truth
              install them in a kingdom of fantasy and pure nonsense.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              I started to think about this when, in Bloomington, Indiana,
              realizing that I was taking my second successive cup of coffee
              with the intention of sweetening my palate for a cigar, a local
              citizen observed that my organism was fond of a certain quantity
              of caffeine, being now unable to live without it.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - A moment, I answered &#8211; Americans drink caffeine. I drink
              coffee.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - And what is the difference?
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - The difference is that, if caffeine as such served as antipasto
              to a cigar, I could drink tea, which sometimes has it in greater
              quantities. However, I abominate tea.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - This is subjective, protested my interlocutor. Biochemically,
              coffee and tea are the same thing.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - With all due respect, my friend: subjective is the distinction
              between the biochemical aspect and the rest of my person. After
              all, it is not my biochemistry that drinks coffee: it is I.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              Biochemically coffee can be tea, but it does not have the same
              flavor, the same aroma, nor the same evocations of childhood, the
              same taste of those long evenings in the country, by the fire,
              listening to ghost stories. No Englishman will trade for coffee
              his tea, under the allegation that it is also caffeine. And the
              Berbers would think it ridiculous to drink tea instead of that
              bitterly dense coffee, with grounds on the bottom.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - These are merely personal and cultural differences.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - Yes, but it is for the seeking of these differences, and not
              only for biochemical effect, that a person drinks coffee or tea.
              If the important part was the biochemical effect, these
              differences that you call cultural would have no reason for being,
              and the drinks could be changed without people being aware of it.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - Why, then, don&#8217;t the caffeine addicts accept decaffeinated
              coffee?
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              - First, because it does not taste like coffee, second because it
              is written in the label: &#8220;Decaffeinated&#8221;, what means
              that it is drunk for the fear of dying, not for the joy of
              living.<br />
              I was not able to convince my American friend.<br />
              But, even if the conversation were not about drinking, it would be
              the same. An American, when is holding a naked woman, believes
              himself to be an animal in search of an orgasm. This effect could
              be obtained more easily through manual or electronic means, if you
              did not count with these &#8220;subjective differences&#8221; that
              separate in our eyes, for example, Brooke Shields from Betty
              Friedman.

              The belief that the scientific point of view is more valid, more
              truthful than the personal motivations with which we explain our
              actions spontaneously has been incorporated to the current
              mentality to such extent that today it substitutes direct
              perception, depreciated as prejudices from old, backward country
              bumpkins. The Americanization of world culture lets us predict
              that this habit will contaminate all the peoples, all the
              cultures. It will become in the end decisive criterion in public
              debates and private disputes between husband and wife, father and
              son, where each one, instead of expressing his feelings, more and
              more will rationalize them with fake arguments of scientific
              origin.
            </p>
            <p align="left">
              <br />
              The problem with this is that all of it comes from a fetishistic
              view &#8211; and this, truly, profoundly backward &#8211; of what
              science is. The point of view of a determined science about
              reality is always a partial and hypothetical cut of it, which only
              has value for the limited proposals of this science, never for the
              generality of knowledge. Even more so because sciences are many,
              and no one knows how to articulate the points of view of all of
              them to create, above common reality, a supra-reality that is more
              truthful. Biochemically, drinking coffee or tea is a lack in
              caffeine, but from the economic point of view it is a pattern of
              consumption determined by a marketing practice that is totally
              detached from the actual composition of these substances.
              Anthropologically, it can be a cultural habit that would resist
              even negative propaganda (like, by the way, happens to smoking).
              No one can synthesize, in a single theory, the biochemistry,
              economy, and anthropology of coffee or tea; however, this
              synthesis is precisely what each one of us innocently does,
              without being able to express it in words, each time we drink,
              with pleasure, our coffee or our tea. Here we find ourselves in
              real life, the <em>Lebenswelt</em> in Husserl, to which science
              &#8211; each science or a group of them &#8211; can only refer to
              in an allusive and indirect way. They are impotent to give account
              of a single concrete fact, with all the density of the inseparable
              determinations that constitute it. We see then that the old
              American love for the hard facts has become today only rhetoric
              pretending. That it now hides a secret devotion to sophisticated
              and artificial theories and schemes, nostalgia of a teenage mental
              omnipotence and preview of the <em>Brave New World</em> in which
              we will live in the 21st century.
