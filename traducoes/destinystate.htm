            To understand the mentality of any person, family, community, or
            tradition, it is necessary to know, more than the external
            conditions that shaped the scenery of their existence, the free acts
            and decisions that distinguished them from all others and
            established the profile of their identity, the pattern of their most
            typical and enduring reactions. Even forgotten, even pressed down to
            the bottom of the unconscious, these self-acquired marks of
            individuality will follow the creatures &#8211; the entities &#8211;
            to the end of their days. Positive or negative, they can never be
            removed, only &#8211; if negative &#8211; compensated, through hard
            work, by new free decisions that neutralize to a certain extent
            their undesired effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Choice makes destiny&quot;, used to say the great Leopold
            Szondi. A succession of individualizing choices leaves its mark in a
            history, a biography, a community, a people, much more than any
            exterior happening that can occur by chance or by the initiative of
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Portuguese, for instance, suffered the earthquake in Lisbon and
            the napoleonic invasion. They were marked by these events, but not
            as deeply as they had already marked themselves by the free
            enterprise of the navigations that turned them, forever, into
            discoverers of the world. The earthquake and the invasion survived
            only as marks from the past. But the navigation epic is the
            permanent signal of Portuguese identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another example: the Jewish suffered the Holocaust, but not because
            they wanted it. It came to them from outside, like an affliction. It
            marked them deeply, but not to the point of erasing their identity.
            This identity was born from what they have done, on their own
            accord, along time. And what they have done of most important was to
            accept, freely, the Law of Moses. Without the Holocaust, they would
            be as Jewish as they always were. They would not be so without the
            Law they chose, that God himself did not impose on them, but only
            offered: &quot;If thou accept me, Israel, I am thy God&quot;. Even
            the decision to call Holocaust the sufferings that were imposed on
            them during the II World War shows the victory of the old identity,
            freely acknowledged, over the dissolving impact of an external
            hostile force. Interpreting the new evil in the light of biblical
            symbolism, the Jewish reconnected the two halves of their thread of
            destiny, which the unpredicted brutality wanted to separate. Yes,
            choice, and not occurrences, makes destiny.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two examples I gave are of dignifying choices. But perverse,
            criminal, dreadful choices mark destiny as deeply. Such is the mark
            of lines of thought and ideologies that promise to make the State
            the reformer of society. Since birth, all of them, without
            exception, chose as their main, unmistakable line of action that
            thing which is proper of the State, that actually defines and
            distinguishes it from all other institutions: the monopoly of
            physical violence. The State is the State only because it has the
            legitimate right &#8211; coerced or consented &#8211; of the use of
            force.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whoever proposes to modify society through the State &#8211; instead
            of doing it through religion, culture, personal influence, free
            association of individuals or the intermediary powers &#8211; knows,
            since the beginning, that essentially their line of action is force.
            The State can, of course, also make use of other means. But none of
            them &#8211; culture, education, propaganda, or prosperity &#8211;
            are innately and exclusively of the State. They are casual
            borrowings. Even the domination that the State might have over them
            lies on the control it might exert over its own medium, which is
            force. That is why any light and affable methods it might use are
            nothing but, in fact, provisory substitutes of force. As soon as
            they fail in giving the desired results, either the State enters a
            period of crisis or of force. <em>Tertium non datur</em>: there is
            no third alternative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Betting on the State is , therefore, to bet on violence. This bet
            indelibly and unmistakably marks the vocation of all modern
            ideologies, either of reforming or revolutionary inclination, that
            see on the State the motor and promoter of social well-being. I do
            not refer only to nazism and socialism. Even forms infinitely minor
            of statism cannot escape the logic of things. Even men of markedly
            democratic convictions like Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D.
            Roosevelt &#8211; or, among Brazilians, the military that succeeded
            each other in presidency after Marshal Castelo Branco &#8211; ended
            up promoting authoritarism and committing violence against their own
            people from the moment that, either through conviction or lack of
            imagination to conceive alternatives, made the State the active
            center of social life and chose it as the essential means for the
            realization of their ideals. Is it not significant that the
            government of the great liberator Lincoln was also the originator of
            concentration camps, which the sincere democrat Roosevelt instated
            against Japanese descendants the prison for racial suspicion? Is it
            not significant that the Brazilian military government, created to
            restore democracy, threatened by the communists, ended up
            fossilizing itself in a repressive apparatus that the government
            itself did not know how to dismantle? And at the same time that,
            making the commitment to defend free market, expanded the State
            machine more than any of its predecessors?
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more eloquent is the example of the &quot;Whigs&quot;, the
            British progressive party, precursors of the Welfare State, who
            invented, before Stalin, the &quot;weapon of hunger&quot;, with the
            infamous Corn Laws, from 1828, which, applied against Ireland,
            reduced its population from eight to four million in a century.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, if true democrats were led to do these things by the simple
            fact that they bet on the State as an instrument to improve society,
            how much more evil will be done by men taken with the idea that the
            State has not only to improve, but to recreate or revolutionize
            society? How much bigger and lasting will be the evil they will
            produce if, instead of revolutionizing only the structure of a
            determined society, they intend to use the force of the State to
            create a new world civilization, modify from top to bottom the
            cultural heritage and moral principles, the religious values, the
            elementary portrayal of perception, and, on the whole, human nature?
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why, when eminent intellectuals announce to us, like they
            did on the Social Forum in the city of Porto Alegre, that
            &quot;another world is possible&quot;, what we must conclude is that
            the hundred million dead of the socialist experience, plus the forty
            million of nazi-fascism, are not enough to satiate the Prometeic
            ambition of the statal inventors of worlds.
