            I&#8217;ve already believed in many lies, but there is a particular
            one to which I was always immune: that which celebrates youth as a
            time of rebelliousness, of independence, of love for freedom. I
            never gave credit to this load of rubbish, not even when, as a young
            man, it flattered me. On the contrary, since my early years I was
            deeply displeased by the conduct of the people from my generation,
            their herd spirit, their fear of isolation, their subservience to
            the current clamor, their compulsion to feel similar and accepted by
            the cynical and authoritary majority, their disposition to give away
            and desecrate everything, in exchange for a vacancy as tyro in the
            group of the &#8220;cool guys&#8221;.
          </p>
          <p>
            Youth, it is true, rebels itself many times against parents and
            teachers, but that is because they know that deep down these people
            are on their side and will never reciprocate their aggressions with
            full force. The fight against parents is a play, a predetermined
            game where one of the competitors is fighting to win and the other
            to help him win.
          </p>

            A lot different is the situation of a teen among those of his
            generation, which do not have towards him the complacence of
            paternalism. Far from protecting him, this noisy and cynical horde
            receives the novice with a degree of disdain and hostility that show
            him, from the beginning, the need to comply not to capitulate. It is
            from the people from his own generation that the teen receives his
            first experience of confrontation with power, without the mediation
            of that difference in age that gives him right to discounts and
            alleviation. It is the reign of the strongest, the most shameless,
            that affirms itself most crudely over the frailty of the newcomer,
            imposing on him torment and demands before accepting him as a member
            of the horde. To how many rites, how many protocols, how many
            humiliations does a postulant submit himself, to escape the
            terrifying perspective of rejection, of isolation. Not to be sent
            back, impotent and humiliated, to the arms of his mother, he has to
            pass an exam that demands of him less courage than flexibility, the
            skill to adapt himself to the whims of the majority &#8211; of
            suppressing, in sum, his personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is true that he submits himself to this with pleasure, with the
            enthusiasm of the man in love that will do anything in exchange of a
            condescending smile. The mass of people from his generation
            represents, after all, the world, the wide world into which the
            teen, coming from the small domestic world, is asking for admission.
            And what a costly admission it is. The candidate must, early on,
            learn a whole new vocabulary of words, gestures, looks, a whole new
            code of passwords and symbols. The slightest flaw exposes to
            ridicule, and the name of the game is in general implicit, and one
            must guess it before one knows it, copy it before guessing. The way
            of learning is always through imitation &#8211; literal, servile,
            and unquestioning. The admission to the juvenile world triggers with
            full speed the drive of all human faltering: the
            <em>mimetic desire</em> that is mentioned by Ren&eacute; Girard,
            where the object does not attract because of its intrinsic
            qualities, but because it is simultaneously desired by another,
            which Girard denominates the mediator.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not surprising that the group admission rite, costing such a
            high psychological investment, drives the youth to complete
            exasperation, preventing him, simultaneously, from pouring his
            resentment back into the group, object of love that denies itself,
            and because of that has the gift of transfiguring each anger impulse
            in new loving investment. Where will, then, the anger turn to,
            except to the least dangerous direction? The family appears as the
            providential scapegoat for all the youth&#8217;s failures in his
            rite of passage. If he is not successful in making himself
            acceptable to the group, the last thing that will occur to him will
            be to blame his situation to the fatuity and cynicism of those who
            reject him. In a cruel inversion, the blame for his humiliations
            will not fall to those that refuse to accept him as a man, but to
            those that accept him as a child. The family that gave him
            everything will pay for the meanness of the horde that demands from
            him everything. This is the summary of the famous teenage
            rebelliousness: love given to the strong ones that reject him, scorn
            for the weak ones who love him.
          </p>
          <p>
            All mutations happen in the shade, in the twilight zone between
            being and not-being: the youth, in transit between what he no longer
            is and what he is yet to be, is, by fatality, unconscious of
            himself, of his situation, of the authorship and the guilt of
            everything that goes on inside and around him. His judgements are
            almost always a total inversion of reality. This is the reason why
            youth, since the cowardly adults have given it the authority to say
            and do whatever it wants, was always at the forefront of all
            mistakes and perversities of the 20th century: nazism, fascism,
            communism, pseudo-religious sects, drug consumption. It is always
            youth that is a step ahead in the worst direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            A world that trusts its future to the discernment of youth is a
            tired, old world, without any future at all.
