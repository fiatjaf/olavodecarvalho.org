                        Thanksgiving Day&#8212;which has been celebrated since
                        the sixteenth century, but was only proclaimed as an
                        official holiday by George Washington&#8212;is one of
                        the last remaining motives for the United States not to
                        become a nation of hateful spoiled brats striving for
                        revenge against their benefactors. Notwithstanding the
                        attempts to inoculate them with bitterness and revolt,
                        in general, Americans continue to be grateful for living
                        in such a rich and generous country, so that in their
                        hearts the love of God is indissolubly mingled with love
                        of country. In the United States it is sometimes hard to
                        know where religion ends and civism begins. Upon
                        proclaiming Thanksgiving Day on October 3, 1789, George
                        Washington wrote, &#8220;It is the duty of all nations
                        to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey
                        His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to
                        implore His protection and favor.&#8221; These words
                        already answered in advance those who deny the
                        Judeo-Christian origin of American political
                        institutions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As some American friends have asked me to celebrate
                        Thanksgiving with them by writing a few lines on the
                        sentiment of gratitude, I decided to take as a starting
                        point something which is the least Christian and Jewish
                        I could find: the ideas of the philosopher Peter Singer,
                        a Princeton professor who does not see much difference
                        between killing a chicken to eat it and strangling a
                        baby to throw him in the trash.<br />
                        Professor Singer's ethics is based upon a set of quite
                        simple and reasonable arguments:<br />
                        1. To cause suffering is indisputably an evil.<br />
                        2. We necessarily cause suffering to animals when we
                        kill and eat them.<br />
                        3. There is no proof that the survival of one animal at
                        the expense of the suffering of another is a good.<br />
                        4. We therefore live by evil, especially when we intend
                        to see a good in our own survival at the expense of
                        others.<br />
                        5. If we add up to the suffering we cause to the animal
                        kingdom the evil we have inflicted upon one another
                        since the origin of time, we will see that evil prevails
                        in the world to such an extent that there remains no
                        plausible reason for us to suppose that a good God has
                        created all this.<br />
                        <br />
                        At first sight, there is no way to refute these
                        arguments. On the contrary, all we can do is accept them
                        and continue to reason based on them, searching for an
                        ethics that does not close its eyes to the hard reality
                        they express.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To begin with, there is no proof that vegetables do not
                        suffer as much as animals when we pull them off the
                        ground, and then cut, cook, and eat them. Since the
                        publication of <em>The Secret Life of Plants</em> by
                        Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird in 1973, until the
                        more recent study by Anthony Trewavas,
                        <em>Green Plants as Intelligent Organisms</em> (2005),
                        evidence has accumulated suggesting that plants possess
                        some cognitive and affective ability. It is true that
                        not everyone in the scientific community accepts these
                        proofs, but the simple fact that the discussion drags on
                        without arriving at a unanimous conclusion imposes on
                        us, in turn, the conclusion that it would be reckless to
                        affirm simply that eating vegetables is a morally
                        inoffensive act.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Even less proof exists that eating exclusively
                        vegetables makes human beings better or less violent.
                        Adolf Hitler was a vegetarian, and the history of the
                        most vegetarian of civilizations, India, is a procession
                        of horrors that continued in the twentieth century, with
                        the massacre of Muslims by Hindus on the occasion of the
                        independence of India, and continues to this day with
                        the systematic slaughter of Christians.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Therefore, there is no formal opposition between
                        Christianity and Professor Singer&#8217;s ideas. But
                        there is a difference of scale, for Professor Singer
                        bases all his ethics upon the observation of what goes
                        on in the material world subjected to quantitative
                        determinations, among which the need for food, whereas
                        the Bible includes the totality of this world in the
                        immeasurably larger picture of the divine infinitude.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        From a Singerian point of view, therefore, no living
                        being&#8212;animal or vegetable&#8212;can be murdered
                        and eaten by human creatures in a moral manner. This
                        amounts to stating that eating, in the most general
                        sense, is a sin and a crime. Yet, if everyone had
                        refrained from committing this crime since the beginning
                        of human history, there would be no human history at
                        all, and we would not be here discussing this lovely
                        subject. The indisputable conclusion that follows is
                        that, in the most general sense, human life is a sin and
                        a crime&#8212;a conclusion endorsed by the Bible itself
                        under the name &#8220;the Fall.&#8221;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It is not necessary to be very intelligent to understand
                        that everything that is quantitative and finite, even if
                        immensely large, is contained in the infinite as a grain
                        of sand at the bottom of the ocean. Infinity has no
                        limitation whatsoever and is, at the same time, the only
                        thing that has to exist necessarily. To claim that the
                        quantitative and finite universe is the ultimate measure
                        of reality is self-contradictory, for one thing only
                        ends where it borders another, so that the very idea of
                        finitude presupposes the existence of the infinite
                        beyond the finite. The finite universe is submitted to
                        the second law of thermodynamics, or entropy, and is not
                        able to survive if it is not continuously re-nourished
                        and regenerated by infinity. Moreover, infinity cannot
                        even be considered exclusively from a quantitative point
                        of view, for quantity is in itself a limitation.
                        Infinity transcends every quantitative determination and
                        can only be conceived as a plethora of unlimited
                        positive qualities, the Supreme Good that Plato spoke
                        of. No rationally defensible argument can be put forward
                        against the existence of the Supreme Good, for all the
                        arguments end up attributing infinity to what they
                        themselves admit as being finite. The Supreme Good is,
                        at the same time, the Supreme Reality.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Seen on the scale of infinity, all the evils of the
                        finite world, immense as they may be, are instantly
                        annulled. It is not possible to conceive a single
                        deprivation or limitation that, on the scale of
                        infinity, is not automatically compensated by the
                        unlimited profusion of its corresponding qualities.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Bible describes the Fall precisely as the instant
                        when human beings lost sight of the scale of infinity,
                        coming to consider the finite world as the ultimate
                        horizon of reality and, for this very reason, finite
                        things as the exclusive object of their desires. The
                        constant pejorative mention of &#8220;carnal
                        desires&#8221; by religious discourse popularly evokes
                        the attraction between the sexes, but this attraction
                        cannot be good or evil in itself, for it may signify
                        both the obsession with sexual possession of a
                        determinate body and an openness to the desire for the
                        infinite love behind its temporary actualization in the
                        affection between two human beings. According to Ernout
                        and Meillet&#8217;s classical etymological dictionary,
                        the word &#8220;carnal,&#8221; from the Latin
                        <em>caro</em>, comes from an Osco-Umbrian stem meaning
                        &#8220;to cut,&#8221; or &#8220;to turn into
                        pieces,&#8221; which subsists more clearly in the Greek
                        <em>karenai</em>, in the Irish <em>scraim</em>, and in
                        the Lithuanian <em>skiriu</em>, all of them meaning
                        &#8220;to cut,&#8221; or &#8220;to separate,&#8221; as
                        well as in the Latin <em>curtus</em> itself, which
                        originated the Portuguese verbs <em>cortar</em>,
                        &#8220;to cut,&#8221; <em>curto</em>,
                        &#8220;short,&#8221; and lastly <em>castrar</em>,
                        &#8220;to castrate.&#8221; The carnal desire condemned
                        by the Bible is the hypnotic affection for earthly goods
                        amputated, cut off, separated from their root in
                        infinity. It is the blind desire for something illusory
                        that, in turn, can only result in the separation of
                        human conscience from the divine ground of
                        reality&#8212;a phenomenon which concentrates in itself
                        the characteristics of alienation, severance, and
                        spiritual castration or self-castration. Castration
                        consists in the loss of the generative capacity, which
                        is therefore regenerative as well. On the scale of
                        infinity, everything that is consumed, lost, extinct, or
                        spent in the realm of matter and time is instantaneously
                        regained and recreated in eternity. Eternity is the
                        infinite regeneration of everything. Everything that
                        entered into existence for a single moment, as fleeting
                        as it may be, can neither come to exist again in time
                        nor disappear from eternity: what once was
                        &#8220;being&#8221; cannot return to
                        &#8220;nothingness,&#8221; because nothingness never
                        was. Considered in itself, separated from infinity, the
                        finite world is the world of continuous extinction, the
                        world of entropy. Spiritual castration consists in
                        losing the sense of perpetual regeneration through a cut
                        between the finite and infinity&#8212;the prison in the
                        &#8220;carnal&#8221; world. In this world, a simple head
                        of lettuce that you may eat is an irreparable loss.
                        Billions of chickens, sheep, cows, and pigs sacrificed
                        in vain on the table of the human species are bloody
                        proofs of the universality of evil and of absurdity.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Professor Singer is totally right in that which concerns
                        the finite world. But curiously, instead of turning
                        gratefully to the infinity that heals and regenerates
                        all, he uses the evil of the finite world as proof of
                        the inexistence of infinity. This does not make sense,
                        since the finite cannot even be conceived in itself as a
                        totality without reference to infinity. This means that
                        Professor Singer condemns the finite world in the very
                        instant that he glorifies it as the ultimate reality,
                        suppressing infinity. But as we have seen, it is this
                        very suppression that makes the finite world evil and
                        unbearable, an image of hell. Professor Singer locks us
                        in hell and then accuses us of living in hell. His
                        arguments against the finite world are true, but on the
                        scale of infinity, they become trite and irrelevant. Our
                        existence only has meaning and value when we recognize
                        the limitations of finitude and, raising our eyes to the
                        infinite, we admit that these limitations are also
                        limited, fleeting, and, in absolute terms, illusory:
                        only divine infinity is truly real. It is divine
                        infinity that makes our life possible, bearable, and
                        full of meaning, unlike the macabre festival of
                        inter-devourment that Professor Singer depicts for us.
                        The sentiment of gratitude toward divine infinity is not
                        a religious ritual, though it can also be one: it is at
                        its basis the only sensible attitude of human beings who
                        recognize the structure of reality and do not let
                        themselves be hypnotized by demonic nightmares, even if
                        they come from Princeton. To give thanks to the Lord is
                        the obligation of all thinking creatures and of all
                        nations.
