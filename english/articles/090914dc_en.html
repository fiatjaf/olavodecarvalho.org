            <p>The Third World movement, an invention of Stalin, turned out to 
              be, and is still today, one of the major sources of the authority 
              of the revolutionary spirit, instilling in the soul of Western civilization 
              an inextinguishable guilt complex and obtaining from it every kind 
              of moral, political and financial profit. Subscribed by international 
              organizations, nourished by billionaire foundations and dozens of 
              governments, trumpeted by indefatigable blabbermouths like Noam 
              Chomsky and Edward Said, enshrined as official doctrine by all big 
              media in Europe and the US, this ideology entirely made of opportunistic 
              mendacity ended up impregnating itself so deeply in public opinion 
              that any attempt at confronting it, even in a neutral and academic 
              tone, is considered today as unequivocal proof of &#8220;racism&#8221;.
            <p>One of its main dogmas is exactly the charge of racism, thrown 
              generically at the face of all Christendom by innumerable armies 
              of activist intellectuals and, in the last decades, by all the speakers 
              for radical Islam. Imbued with the belief in the innate inferiority 
              of blacks, white European man would have been, according to this 
              doctrine, the slave-master <em>par excellence</em>, decimating the 
              African population and financing, through the disgrace of the black 
              continent, the industrial revolution which made the West wealthy.</p>
            <p>Everything in this theory is a lie, beginning with the chronological 
              inversion. Europeans only arrived in Africa around the middle of 
              the 15th century. Well before that time, racist contempt for blacks 
              was common sense among Arabs, as one can see in the words of some 
              of its most prominent intellectuals. I draw these examples from 
              Bernard Lugan&#8217;s book, <em>Afrique, l'Histoire &agrave; l'Endroit</em> 
              (Paris, Perrin, 1989).</p>
            <p>Ibn Khaldun, the Tunisian historian (1332-1406), assures us that 
              if the Sudanese are characterized by &#8220;levity and inconstancy&#8221;, 
              in the more Southern regions &#8220;we only find men who are closer 
              to animals than to an intelligent being. They live in wild places 
              and in caves, eat herbs and raw grains and sometimes they eat each 
              other. We cannot consider them human beings.&#8221;</p>
            <p>The Egyptian writer Al-Abshihi (1388-1446) asks: &#8220;What can 
              there be that is worse and more vile than black slaves? As for the 
              mulattos, be good to them every day of your life and in every possible 
              way, and they will have no gratitude for you: it will be as if you 
              had done nothing for them. The better you treat them, the more they 
              become insolent; but if you mistreat them, they will show humility 
              and submission&#8221;.</p>
            <p>Iyad Al-Sabti (1083-1149) writes that the blacks are &#8220;of 
              all men the most corrupt and the most disposed to procreation. Their 
              life is like that of an animal. They have no interest in any matter 
              of the world, except for food and women. Apart from that, nothing 
              merits their attention.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Ibn Butlan, recognizing that black women have the rhythmic sense 
              and the resistance for hard work, observes: &#8220;But one cannot 
              obtain any pleasure from them, such is the odor of their armpits 
              and the roughness of their body.&#8221;</p>
            <p>In contrast, theories affirming the racial inferiority of blacks 
              were not disseminated in cultured Europe before the 18th century 
              (cf. Eric Voegelin, <em>The History of the Race Idea. From Ray to 
              Carus</em>, vol. III of his <em>Collected Works</em>, Baton Rouge, 
              Louisiana State University Press, 1998). That is to say that Europeans 
              of the literate classes became racists almost at the same time as 
              the slave trade declined and abolitionist movements began, of which 
              there is no equivalent in the Arab world, as slavery is permitted 
              by the Islamic religion, and nobody would dare to directly confront 
              a commandment from the Koran.</p>
            <p>Anti-black racism is a total Arab creation and in Europe it did 
              not contribute at all to encourage slave trade.</p>
            <p>Another typical inversion of historical time is the universally 
              held stereotype of the European colonialist invading Africa with 
              a crucifix in his hand, firmly resolved to impose the white man&#8217;s 
              religion on defenseless populations. Christianity was the religion 
              of blacks long before it was the religion of white Europeans. There 
              were churches in Ethiopia during the time when the English were 
              still pagan barbarians. More than a thousand years before the great 
              navigations, it was in Africa that one could find the oldest Christian 
              kingdoms, some of them very cultured and prosperous. It was the 
              Arabs who destroyed them, in their craving to islamize everything 
              by force. A good part of the region that stretches from Morocco, 
              Libya, Algeria and Egypt to Sudan and Ethiopia was Christian until 
              the Muslims arrived, burned down the churches and sold Christians 
              as slaves. 80% of the prestige of the tales of the Third World movement 
              lie on the occultation of this fact.</p>
            <p>As it invariably occurs with the revolutionary discourse, the chronological 
              inversion is accompanied by the inversion of moral responsibility. 
              It is not necessary to say that the verbal fury of Arabs today against 
              the &#8220;slave-trading Christian civilization&#8221; is purely 
              projected guilt: if the Europeans brought between 12 and 15 million 
              slaves to the Americas, Arab merchants took to Islamic countries 
              approximately the same amount, with three differences: (1) the Arabs 
              would capture them, something which the Europeans never did, except 
              in Angola and for a brief period; (2) the Arabs castrated at least 
              ten percent of the slaves, a custom that was not known to European 
              slave-traders; (3) the Arabs continued to practice slave trade up 
              to the 20th century. The slavery practiced by the Arabs was a forbidden 
              subject for a long time, but the taboo can be considered broken 
              since the publisher Gallimard, the most prestigious in France, agreed 
              to publish the excellent study of the African author Tidiane N'Diaye, 
              <em>Le Genocide Voil&eacute;</em> (2008), which I will comment some 
              other day.</p>
            <p>But it is not only the Arabs that have to cover up their guilt 
              behind a discourse of resentful accusations. Slavery was the general 
              norm in Africa well before the Arabs arrived there, and today we 
              know that the largest part of captured slaves was sold in the internal 
              market, while only a smaller number was taken abroad. When the apologists 
              of African civilization praise the great black kingdoms of the past, 
              they generally omit mentioning that these States (especially Benin, 
              Dahomey, Ashanti and Oyo) owed their prosperity to the slave trade, 
              on which their economy was entirely dependent. Particularly the 
              kingdom of Oyo, writes Lugan, &#8220;developed a notable military 
              imperialism since the end of the 17th century, seeking to reach 
              the ocean in order to establish direct contacts with the white men. 
              Even before this, the warring strength of the Oyo, especially their 
              cavalry, enabled them to reap an abundant harvest of slaves which 
              it imprisoned in the south, among the Yoruba, and in the north, 
              among the Bariba and the Nupe. Traditionally the numerous captives 
              became slaves in the victors&#8217; society. With the establishment 
              of European slave trade a part &#8211; but only a part &#8211; was 
              sent to the coast.&#8221;</p>
            <p>In a forthcoming article I will show some other prodigious inversions 
              that the discourse of the Third World movement operates in the history 
              of African slavery.</p>
