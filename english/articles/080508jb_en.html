                  When the Swiss painter and poet Frithjof Schuon
                  (1907&#8211;1998) returned from the East in the forties,
                  transfigured into the supreme master of one of the most
                  influential Muslim esoteric organizations and announcing that
                  he would Islamize Europe, he gave the clear impression of
                  being completely mad. Today it behooves us to examine with
                  humility his words and the course of his actions, whose
                  overwhelming efficiency contrasts with the total discretion
                  with which they were undertaken.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To begin with, the creation of Schuon&#8217;s
                  <em>tariqah</em> (Islamic initiation lodge) in Lausanne was
                  hailed by the esoteric writer Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non
                  (1886&#8211;1951) as the only promising result of his own
                  efforts of four decades. This clearly shows the meaning of
                  those efforts and, the later rupture between Gu&eacute;non and
                  Schuon notwithstanding, evinces the perfect continuity of the
                  work of these two esoterists, whose respective disciples
                  nowadays prefer hating one another to celebrating the common
                  victory over a spiritually weakened Europe.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Gu&eacute;non, the author of masterly analyses of the decay of
                  the European West, had concluded in the 1920s that only three
                  roads offered themselves to this civilization: the fall into
                  barbarism, the restoration of the Catholic Church, or
                  Islamization. On uttering those words about Frithjof Schuon,
                  he had already given up the second alternative. The fiasco of
                  the Second Vatican Council, whose appearances the popes have
                  in vain been trying to save, proved in the end that his
                  diagnosis was, in outline, correct.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The radically de-Christianized Europe is today the stage of an
                  open strife between barbarism and Islamism. There is no third
                  way, apparently (&#8220;secular civilization&#8221; is a
                  joke). The possibility of rescuing the Christian option
                  depends entirely on the American influence or on the admirable
                  dedication of Eastern and African priests and pastors, who, in
                  a paradoxical turn of history, have come to try to recatechize
                  the people by whom they were Christianized.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The action of such characters as Gu&eacute;non and Schuon goes
                  unnoticed by the media, political analysts, and
                  &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; in general, whose eyes are
                  hypnotically fixed upon the garish surface of events. But
                  without it the &#8220;occupation from within&#8221; by means
                  of immigration would have remained innocuous for lack of the
                  cultural conditions that disarmed the European intellectual
                  and political elite. Gu&eacute;non and Schuon contributed much
                  to create them, subjugating the uppermost and most circumspect
                  strata of this elite to the intellectual superiority of the
                  East in every decisive area except the natural sciences and
                  technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Gu&eacute;non wrote his first articles under the pseudonym
                  Sphynx, denoting that his readers had no choice but to profit
                  from his lessons intelligently or to let themselves be
                  dominated without ever understanding them. In a single
                  European country those lessons have been meditated with
                  serious intent by independent thinkers: Romania. When I lived
                  in Bucharest, I found there not a single eminent intellectual
                  who did not have a profound and critical understanding of
                  Gu&eacute;non&#8217;s work.
                </p>

                <p>
                  What has been seen in the rest of Europe is the oscillation
                  between obtuse rejection and devout submission, including a
                  significant number of secret conversions to Islam and the
                  regimentation of many intellectuals and leaders&#8212;among
                  them the prospective king of England&#8212;into the scheme of
                  state protection of Islamic expansionism. It is no coincidence
                  that Romania is one of the rare European countries where the
                  Muslim penetration is negligible.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To give an idea of how powerful the subtle influence of
                  Gu&eacute;non and Schuon has been, it suffices to inform that
                  the latter interfered directly in producing the crisis between
                  Monsignor Lef&egrave;vre and the Vatican in 1976, and until
                  now the Catholic historians&#8212;whether progressive or
                  conservative&#8212;have not taken the slightest notice of
                  that.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I know that this article of mine is addressed to few readers
                  and that, among these, some of those who can more or less
                  understand it will definitely hate it. But there are things
                  that one must say just in order not to be accused, in the
                  future, of bearing witness only too late.
