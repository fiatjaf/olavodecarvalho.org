            <i>O Globo</i>, May 3rd, 2003
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The other day, in one of his columns, Carlos Heitor Cony said that
            almost all violence in Rio de Janeiro comes from drug trafficking.
            Deep down, everyone knows this. But not many grasp that just this
            fact is enough to refute, at its basis, the clich&eacute; that
            poverty causes crime. How can poverty spawn a billion-dollar
            business that buys arms in the Middle East in order to exchange them
            for 200 tons of cocaine annually from the FARC? What an amazing
            miracle of <i>ex nihilo</i> creation that would be! A profusion of
            books, films, articles and interviews bewilders the public in order
            to force upon them the belief in this miracle. But these
            disseminations themselves are no miracle: they can be explained by
            the ideological solidarity between drug traffickers and the caste of
            leftist intellectuals and artists, who are more or less willing
            instruments of a cynical operation of deception: nothing is more
            comfortable, for those who seek the destruction of society through
            violence and crime, than counting on a public relations team which
            keeps the real actors and beneficiaries of the destruction hidden
            and above suspicion via grandiloquent attacks at generic targets
            such as &#147;poverty&#148;, &#147;exclusion&#148;, and &#147;social
            injustice&#148;.
          </p>
          <p>
            But some are not content with this. They go even further: they turn
            to the public who have paid to be fooled and blame them for
            everything:
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;You among the middle class who read books and watch movies,
            are the exploiters, the ones to blame for the social exclusion that
            forces the humiliated and offended into criminality.&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            The reaction among the audience shows that the blow has landed on
            the solar plexus: people who wouldn&#146;t hurt a fly walk out
            feeling guilty for having a car, a house and a job in a country in
            which so many excluded people, because of their lack of the minimum
            resources for a dignified life, are forced &#150; poor fellows!
            &#150; to spend fortunes on cocaine in Colombia in order to resell
            it to Brazilian children at the gates of their schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stereotype, condensed into Rio&#146;s image of the impoverished
            hill neighborhoods at the edge of the wealthy city, has become
            deeply rooted in the soul of the ordinary citizen, who, without
            remembering having done anything wrong, suddenly discovers himself,
            according to the prophets of the media and of show business, to be
            guilty of the most heinous of crimes: social injustice.
          </p>
          <p>
            And no one stops to make calculations: how much money goes from the
            city up to the hills, and how much comes down? How much in drugs?
            How much in assaults and hostage rescues? How much in taxes for
            medical assistance, water and telephone for people who never pay for
            such things?
          </p>
          <p>
            Do the numbers, and tell me: who, in this situation, is the
            exploited, and who is the exploiter? If the bloody fortune that goes
            up the hills were to remain there, those hills would be Switzerland.
            But, instead, it goes to the Fernandinhos<sup
              ><a name="1" href="#nota1">1</a></sup
            >, and from them to the FARC. The origins of crime in the state of
            Rio de Janeiro are not to be found in poverty, crime and poverty
            share the same origins: the poor of Rio are exploited, but not by
            &#147;us&#148;, the middle class. They are exploited by crime lords,
            who enslave them in order to use them in illicit activities, and
            even use them as a public relations symbol to hide behind billboards
            against &#147;social exclusion&#148;.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the accusatory speech against the middle class remains effective,
            it is because the speaker wisely refrains from saying
            &#147;you&#148;. A directly accusatory speech would become
            antipathetic. One must give the accusation an air of confession, so
            that the accuser does not appear to be speaking against the audience
            but rather in the audience&#146;s name. Then, widening his eyes like
            an expressionist actor and histrionically beating his chest, he
            shouts &#147;We!&#148;, as if he wanted to assume part of the blame.
            But in the midst of this speech he does not present himself as what
            he is: a member of the leftist intelligentsia, an advocate of
            banditry. During the performance he carries out the generic role of
            a man of the middle class, making himself a decoy and pretending to
            draw guilt to himself, only to, in a <i>Ju-Jitsu</i> move, dodge it
            at the last instant and let it fall upon the audience, while,
            slipping quickly from the role of accused to that of prosecution
            witness, he escapes unharmed. The malice required for this trick is
            almost demonic. Dostoyevsky was right in calling these types of
            intellectuals &#147;The Devils&#148;.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not surprising that, among these individuals, the adhesion to
            the liberation dogma is almost unanimous. Once drug trafficking is
            legalized in the largest consumer market in Latin America, the
            regular and legal flow of money to Colombian guerrillas would be
            guaranteed, with plenty of fiscal incentives and subsidies from the
            State to reward the writers and filmmakers who fought the good fight
            during the difficult times of repression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Millions of lives would be discarded down the drain of addiction and
            madness, but this would be a small price to pay for the glory of
            hallucinogenic socialism and for the prosperity of its literary,
            journalistic, and cinematic apostles.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is unnecessary to discuss theoretically, abstractly, the
            hypothetical damages and benefits of the legalization of drugs: it
            fits clearly into a criminal strategy of continental revolution, so
            one must merely identify its place and function in the general plan
            in order to find out how evil it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the USSR faucet turned off, the communist movement in the
            continent today has one single source of financial support: crime
            &#150; drug trafficking. If they want to legalize it, it is only to
            prevent themselves from remaining too long in the dual and
            uncomfortable role of being both its material supporters and its
            supposed persecutors. When a politician backed by a revolutionary
            scheme finds himself elevated to power by legal means in a
            democracy, he stays in that ambiguous position, in which he cannot
            remain indefinitely without being unmasked. So, before the situation
            gets worse, it is necessary to change the rules of the game, making
            the illicit licit and relieving him of the painful burden of
            pretending that he is persecuting those whom he is secretly
            promising to help. Hence the call for the legalization of drugs.

              <a name="nota1">Fernandinho Beira-Mar</a> is an extremely
              periculous Brazilian drug dealer. Altough he is currently
              arrested, his power among the crime organizations remains very
              high, to a point that he has already been moved from one State to
              another many times in an effort to break his leadership. &#150;
