          <p>
            When some politician of the right or simply empty of ideological
            convictions is accused of taking money from the budget and his party
            tries to elude the investigations, the media all together denounce
            the dirty little game, and with pretenses of deep indignation, shout
            for &#147;transparency&#148;<sup
              ><a name="1" href="#nota1">1</a></sup
            >. But, the President of the Republic was not accused of vulgar
            corruption. He was accused of receiving, when he was a candidate,
            financial help from the largest criminal organization on the
            continent, responsible for a massive supply of cocaine to the
            national market.
          </p>
          <p>
            To discourage the investigations, he did not resort to any
            parliamentary trick, but to direct intimidation, announcing that he
            is going to sue the denouncer, deputy Alberto Fraga (PMDB-DF), for
            the crime of exercising a basic prerogative of his job. At the same
            time &#150; according to what I read in Elio Gaspari&#146;s column
            &#150;, agents of the government are arranging to prevent Boris
            Casoy<sup><a name="2" href="#nota2">2</a></sup> from again hurting
            the sensitive soul of the president. He was the only interviewer of
            the S&atilde;o Paulo TV who dared to ask da Silva something about
            the Farc during the electoral campaign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Worse still, by mobilizing the General Law Office of the Union
            against Alberto Fraga to sue him, the President of the Republic
            makes use of a public organ as if it were the office of his private
            lawyers. The deputy&#146;s offense &#150; if there is any offense in
            requesting an investigation &#150; was not made against the
            Presidency, but to Mr. da Silva and his party, who are the only ones
            involved in the case and on whom falls the obligation to give back,
            from their own pockets, the costs of each minute of work done by the
            lawyers of the Union in a case of private interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            And nobody in the media seems to be scandalized with such matters,
            nor do they demand that the accusations be checked, nor criticize
            the President&#146;s &#147;privatization&#148; of the General Law
            Office. The journalist class seems devoted to covering up both the
            denunciation and its repression; the former brought to the public
            only by me and by the press in Brasilia, the latter in half a dozen
            newspapers which put the news in highly discreet bottom of the page
            boxes without any mention whatsoever of the irregularities of the
            presidential procedure. Meanwhile, in Parliament and on TV, there
            echoes a nasty cacophony of incomparably less serious offenses
            associated with Ant&ocirc;nio Carlos Magalh&atilde;es.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pejorative messages about deputy Fraga have already started to go
            around the internet, in a &#147;character assassination&#148;
            effort, coming from no one knows where, but targeted at destroying
            the public interest in the proof and documents that the deputy
            promises to present in the investigation, which counts with,
            we&#146;re told, 127 supporting signatures according to the deputy,
            lacking only 45 to make it official.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not know Alberto Fraga and I know nothing of his virtues and
            sins, but what I do know is that in the times of Fernando Collor<sup
              ><a name="3" href="#nota3">3</a></sup
            >, nobody alleged that his brother&#146;s bad moral attributes were
            an excuse for not listening to his testimony. I do know that against
            the &#147;budget dwarves&#148;<sup
              ><a name="4" href="#nota4">4</a></sup
            >
            nobody felt ashamed of calling upon a notorious crook and murderer
            as witness. What does it matter then if the denouncer wears a white
            or black hat? All that I hope for is that the proof he claims to
            have about what seems to be the greatest electoral crime of all
            times be revealed. But it does not surprise me that the first ones
            to try to cover it up are precisely the apostles of
            &#147;transparency&#148;: glass roofs are, by definition,
            transparent.<sup><a name="5" href="#nota5">5</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            The President of the Republic was the founder, and for ten years,
            highest leader of the Foro de S&atilde;o Paulo, the coordination of
            the communist movement on this continent, in which legal parties of
            the left could articulate in common strategy with terrorist and
            criminal organizations like the Farc and the Chilean MIR &#150; the
            latter the largest &#147;shareholder&#148; of the Brazilian
            kidnapping industry. That alone should be enough to make him
            suspect, and his actions in such shady groups should be carefully
            investigated.
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of that, in the 2002 elections, the expression &#147;Foro
            de S&atilde;o Paulo&#148; was totally suppressed from the media and
            from the debates. Never in 37 years in journalism have I seen such a
            generalized, cynical and stubborn effort at cover-up. But, how could
            it be different? Of Mr. da Silva&#146;s competitors, two were his
            partners in the Foro de S&atilde;o Paulo and the third, who knew
            about it all, would never wish for anything in this world to disturb
            with unpleasant conversations an election that had been planned to
            be an intimate celebration of the leftist parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, I wrote a lot against all this, but categorically
            rejected any hypothesis of financial interest in the connections
            between da Silva and the Colombian narcoguerrillas. Now, faced with
            the new denunciations, the silence of the media, of the politicians
            and of the business leadership ceases to be merely immoral, becoming
            in fact clearly criminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            When all the educated elite of a country becomes so subservient to
            the false leftist morality, it is ready to confess that, at the end
            of the day, a presidential candidate who receives money from
            narcotrafficking has done nothing wrong at all, as long as it is
            &#147;leftist&#148; narcotraffic. And, thus, to compare Brazil and
            Colombia is excessively optimistic: in Colombia, the Farc are hated
            by 98% of the population. Here, there is no kindness that is enough
            to please them. The President of the Republic has refused to call
            them what they are; three commanders of the organization are
            sheltered on national territory while at the same time the Ministry
            of Defense alleges it has nothing against them; and the guerrilla
            instructors it sends to improve the violence in Rio are labeled by
            the media as &#147;dissidents&#148; &#150; without the least proof
            that they are &#150; so as not to stain the reputation of this
            distinctly homicidal organization.

              President, Mr. Luis In&aacute;cio &#147;Lula&#148; da Silva. He
              governed from 1990 until 1992, when the accusations made by his
              brother Pedro caused his impeachment and the deprivation of his
              political rights for 8 years. It must be noted that: a) he was
              responsible for the first openings of the Brazilian market to the
              outside world and for the beginning of the privatization (as far
              as this term is valid in the Brazilian context) of the state owned
              companies; b) most of the Brazilian people were happy about his
              fall because of, among other reasons, the confiscation he had made
              of millions of savings accounts on a failed heterodox attempt to
              solve the country&#146;s economic problems; c) none of the
