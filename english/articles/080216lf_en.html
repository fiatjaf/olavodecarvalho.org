                  At the time of this writing, the Republican Party is torn
                  between Baptist pastor Mike Huckabee and war veteran John
                  McCain. The Democrats have not yet decided between Barack
                  Obama and Hillary Clinton. The American electoral picture is
                  thus divided between three enigmas and a frightening
                  certainty. No one has the faintest idea of what to expect from
                  the first three should they be elected, but the last has the
                  resume necessary to complete the job of dismantling the
                  American presidency, a job that was started with brilliant
                  success by her husband with the aid of Chinese spies, thieving
                  lobbyists, Miss Monica Lewinsky, and drug dealers of the FARC
                  &#8212; who struck it rich with the famous Colombia Plan
                  &#8212; and last but not least, a plethora of intelligence
                  agents placed in the CIA to serve the Clinton family instead
                  of the American state. The major advantage in favor of Hillary
                  Clinton is that, as Paulo Francis would say, everyone had
                  already seen this movie and knew who would die at the end. At
                  a time of such uncertainty, this could generate some votes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Huckabee presents himself as the &#8220;social
                  conservative,&#8221; but at the same time supports stem-cell
                  research, putting his voters in a major quandary. What he has
                  in his favor is that nothing as catastrophic is expected of
                  him as is of the other three. If he manages to prove he is
                  harmless, he might still have a chance against McCain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only John McCain knows what is going on inside his head. He
                  has already proven he is capable of changing his mind in an
                  instant and throttling forthwith anyone who opposes the
                  change. Conservatives say he is the most Democratic of the
                  Republicans, that he is impossible to clearly distinguish from
                  Senator Ted Kennedy, and that he can scarcely suppress an
                  orgasm whenever he sees a tax increase; but on the left there
                  are those who swear he is to the right of George W. Bush, that
                  he is the hawk&#8217;s hawk, and the first thing he will do in
                  the presidency is bomb Iran and unleash World War III (or IV).
                  Perhaps all of this is true, but certainly, none of it is
                  good. Of the four candidates, he is still the one best
                  positioned to be elected, but it is a sure thing that many of
                  his constituents will vote for him in fear and trembling,
                  realizing they are doing so only to prevent one of the parties
                  from dominating the presidency along with the Senate, the
                  House and the majority vote in the Supreme Court, making it
                  omnipotent (Americans instinctively hate this).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for Senator Obama, he is certainly less interesting than
                  the reasons many Americans have for voting for him. If someone
                  is constantly accused of a defect to the point of developing a
                  complex about it, he will most likely wind up with the
                  opposite defect. If applied skillfully, the trick is almost
                  foolproof. Accuse a guy of being a skinflint and he will
                  become a compulsive spendthrift. Accuse him of being a male
                  chauvinist and he will wind up being henpecked. While racism
                  in the USA has been a very geographically limited phenomenon,
                  the whole country has been accused so much of racism that
                  Americans in general wound up sacrificing their dignity to a
                  grotesque fad of political correctness. And now many of them
                  feel obliged to vote for Barak Hussein Obama only to show that
                  they are nice. The senator speaks beautifully, but so far no
                  one has been able to discern in his discourse anything that
                  remotely resembles an issue. In the most substantive scenario,
                  there appears to be some promise of a campaign similar to that
                  of his opponent Hillary Clinton, if not that of the Republican
                  candidates. Like McCain, he promises to deliver Osama bin
                  Laden&#8217;s head, that is, of course, if he can find it.
                  Like Mrs. Clinton, he promises free medical care for everyone
                  (not only for the poor, handicapped and aged), but without
                  ever thinking of explaining from whom he will get the money to
                  do this, or for that matter, how he will fill the gap in the
                  budget, which is already reckoned in the trillions. The
                  senator has specialized in adolescent exhortations of the type
                  &#8220;we&#8217;re going to change the world,&#8221; because
                  he knows that no one expects him to actually do something in
                  the presidency, only that he&#8217;ll be there as a symbol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A symbol of what? The ancient Latins said
                  <em>nomen est omen</em>, &#8220;the name is prophecy.&#8221;
                  Barak Hussein means &#8220;blessed descendent of the
                  Prophet,&#8221; and there is conclusive evidence that its
                  bearer is lying when he says he was never a Muslim (Daniel
                  Pipes made that clear
                  <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/article/5286">here</a> and
                  <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/article/5354">here</a>).
                  It is more or less as if, in the midst of the Vietnam war, the
                  USA had elected as its president a guy named John Paul Ho Chi
                  Minh, educated in Hanoi, the son of a party member, who swore
                  he had never been a Communist and became offended when anyone
                  doubted it. Obama&#8217;s candidacy is a calculated
                  provocation, serving as a gauge to assess the depth of the
                  acquired habit of politically correct self-censorship now
                  infused in the minds of Americans willing to be thrown into
                  the oven to avoid offending the cook.
                </p>

                  A significant detail illustrates this to a tee: when the
                  senator listens to the national anthem, he does not place his
                  right hand on his heart as protocol demands but literally
                  shields his private parts with both hands, and everyone feels
                  too inhibited to say that this is an insult. A similar test
                  was conducted in Bill Clinton&#8217;s time. The president took
                  the liberty of transforming the White House into a brothel,
                  lied shamelessly and cried right wing conspiracy whenever
                  anyone thought ill of anything. The air of indignation on
                  Democrats&#8217; faces when they defended the
                  scoundrel&#8217;s honor was touching. In both cases, the most
                  cynical ban on perceiving the obvious is imposed in the name
                  of morality, instilling in public opinion the habit of
                  <a href="/semana/071029dc.html">revolutionary inversion</a>.
                  All of this seems quite extravagant, but it is a masterpiece
                  of high precision psychological engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The panorama of this election is dismal in all aspects. Mitt
                  Romney displayed the stature of a statesman precisely in his
                  withdrawal speech. He said the present election was about
                  major issues, not administrative routines. Never has the USA
                  had to decide on such grave matters with such lightweight
                  brains to bear the responsibility. The disproportion between
                  the problems and the cast of characters is tragicomical, but
                  the comedy will pass away and the tragedy will become reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blame for the present situation is shared equally between
                  the Democrats, who put their own political ambitions ahead of
                  the security of the USA, and George W. Bush, who refused to
                  notice this, preferring to embark the country on an illusory
                  national union against the foreign enemy. The union
                  didn&#8217;t last three weeks. Any intelligent observer could
                  have seen this, but Bush staked everything on the patriotism
                  card without noticing that the patriotism of his adversaries
                  was completely fake.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the American tradition, public officials, particularly
                  higher ranking ones, have always been proud to serve the
                  State, regardless of which party was in power. Since the
                  Clinton era, the Democratic Party has broken with this
                  tradition, supporting, in the bureaucratic network, militants
                  who served the party, not the state, the people or the nation.
                  We also saw this happening in a certain country. Isn&#8217;t
                  it the same thing? And we all know how it ended. Since 9/11,
                  George W. Bush&#8217;s war plans have been boycotted from
                  within by the clintonistas in the State Department and the
                  CIA, who thus produced unsustainable situations, the blame for
                  which was shifted to the president. The story is told in
                  detail in the book by Kenneth R. Timmerman, Shadow Warriors,
                  the Untold Story of Traitors, Saboteurs, and the Party of
                  Surrender (Crown Forum, New York, 2007), and anyone who does
                  not know it will never understand what is happening today in
                  the USA. Refusing to acknowledge evil is just as shameful as
                  what caused it. George W. Bush incurs the costs and
                  responsibility of having deserted the internal battle through
                  the subterfuge of an overseas war. Bush&#8217;s timidity (or
                  surrender) destroyed it all. &#8220;<em
                    >Par d&eacute;licatesse j&#8217;ai perdu ma vie</em
                  >&#8221; [through delicacy I lost my life], said Rimbaud. But
                  this prophecy, unfortunately, applies not only to the person
                  of the current American president. It is an entire people who
                  risk misfortune to avoid the indiscretion of naming the names
                  of their enemies.
