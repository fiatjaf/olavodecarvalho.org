                  What is happening in the American news media is terrifying for
                  those who can see through it. Exaggeration? Conspiracy theory?
                  A recent example will allow you to judge for yourself and draw
                  your own conclusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was accused of
                  attempting to sell Obama&#8217;s Senate seat, the first
                  question that came to the mind of police authorities was
                  whether the President-elect had partnered with him or at least
                  was aware of what was going on. There was no hiding the
                  question, not only because it came directly from the U.S.
                  Attorney&#8217;s Office, but also because, a few weeks
                  earlier, one of the main Obamist campaign aides, David
                  Axelrod, had mentioned in an interview a recent meeting
                  between Obama and governor Blagojevich. Obama&#8217;s
                  reassuring reply came right away, after, according to him, a
                  thorough internal investigation, and was promptly trumpeted by
                  the media as the final solution to the riddle: No, not even
                  Obama himself, nor any member of his team had had any contact
                  whatsoever with Blagojevich. Axelrod was quick to confirm it,
                  swearing that his first declaration had been just a slip-up.
                  With that, the media announced en bloc, to the general relief
                  of the believers, that Blagojevich&#8217;s fall did not in any
                  way stain the anointed Messiah&#8217;s honor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Displeased with such a facile clarification, the non-profit
                  organization Judicial Watch subpoenaed Blagojevich, under the
                  Freedom of Information Act, to disclose all official records
                  of any recent contact between the governor and Barack Obama or
                  any member of his team. What came in response was astounding,
                  to say the least: a letter written on the Presidential
                  Transition Team&#8217;s letterhead, signed personally by
                  Barack Obama, in which he thanked Blagojevich for the meeting
                  they had had in Philadelphia on December 2, only a week before
                  the Illinois governor was arrested. Even worse: not only had
                  Obama and Blagojevich taken part into the conversation, but so
                  had Vice-President-elect Joe Biden. The document can be read
                  at
                  <a
                    href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/2009/BlagojevichFOIAresponse122408.pdf"
                    >http://www.judicialwatch.org/documents/2009/BlagojevichFOIAresponse122408.pdf</a
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>It is full and official proof that Obama lied.</p>
                <p>
                  Well, do you know how many newspapers have publicized that so
                  far? None. How many TV news programs? None. Complete silence,
                  total protection of the darling&#8217;s image. No matter how
                  many documents are made public, no matter how many facts are
                  unveiled and thoroughly proved, no matter how many crimes and
                  misdemeanors he might have committed, not a single word
                  against Obama will be read or heard in the elegant media. The
                  abyss between news and reality has become immeasurable,
                  insurmountable. With crushing unanimity, reporters, editors
                  and commentators lie, conceal, obfuscate, change the subject
                  and, with shocking cynicism, laugh at anyone who tries to do
                  journalism the old fashioned way, the fact-and-document
                  journalism, whose days are numbered, surviving only on the
                  internet and talk radio. Nothing of what has been previously
                  seen in Western democracies in terms of counterfeiting and
                  news manipulation can compare to this absolute and relentless
                  blockade, which can only be matched by totalitarian censorship
                  in communist countries, the difference being that the latter
                  was imposed by the government, while the first arises from
                  voluntary complicity &#8211; a systemic and not conspiratorial
                  one, exactly as predicted by communist strategist Antonio
                  Gramsci.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More than Obama&#8217;s election itself, this phenomenon
                  signals a historical sea-change, destined to bear devastating
                  consequences on a global scale. Decades of indoctrination in
                  the universities, based on the premise that there is no
                  reality, just the &#8220;imposition of the narrative,&#8221;
                  have accomplished their goal: a new generation of journalists
                  has come to power at the news rooms, deeply imbued with the
                  strong belief that their duty is not to depict the world, but
                  to transform it. The honorable public, likewise, is supposed
                  to be swept up by this change, without knowing where it comes
                  from or where it will lead to. Whether this curtain of
                  darkness will remain closed for a thousand or just a few
                  years, I don&#8217;t know.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What is certain is that it&#8217;s already descended upon the
                  land that was once home to the free press.
