                  In a world degraded by the arrogance of modernity, the fact
                  that the Legionaries of Christ are an organization nominally
                  devoted to reliving the experience of traditional Catholicism
                  only makes the crimes perpetrated by both its founder and its
                  other leaders all the more serious.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The relationship between the seeming traditionalism of the
                  Legionaries and the modernist deformations of Catholicism is
                  exactly the same as the one St. Augustine observed between
                  pride and the other capital sins: all vices, said he, cling to
                  evil that evil may be accomplished; pride alone clings to the
                  good that good may perish.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modernists and leftists in general preach error and lies,
                  deform doctrine and liturgy, and do the reverse of what the
                  Church has done for two millennia. Marcial Maciel and his
                  partisans preach the authentic doctrine, follow the rituals
                  faithfully and, seen from the outside, look much like the good
                  Catholics of old, except that they reduce all this to a shell,
                  to a camouflage in the service of crime and wickedness. The
                  former attack the Church from the outside, ostensibly
                  stripping it of everything which adorns and protects it; the
                  latter preserve its vestments and its physiognomy, all the
                  while wounding it directly in the heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The damage Maciel and his gang did to Catholicism even reaches
                  the point of surpassing, in some respects, the overall effect
                  of so many blows accumulated over more than one hundred years.
                  Under attack from external enemies or heretics and infiltrated
                  agents, the Church not only preserved its dignity but shone
                  even brighter by means of the glory of martyrdom. Now it is
                  forced to humiliate itself before the world, apologizing for
                  the evil that well-disguised enemies inflicted upon it not
                  from without, but from its innermost circle, under the asinine
                  protection of a pope, John Paul II, who did not want to see
                  the truth in time and ended up protecting the criminals
                  instead of helping the victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If making the Church pay for the crimes of its betrayers
                  already constitutes a monstrous injustice, even more
                  intolerable are the attempts to mitigate the scandal, reducing
                  everything to the personal sins of a priest and saving the
                  appearances of the organization he created.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The plea for forgiveness released by the order&#8217;s current
                  superior, &Aacute;lvaro Corcuera, is a masterpiece of cynicism
                  and issue-dodging. On the one hand, it reduces everything down
                  to sex offenses, now four-decades-old, and says nothing of the
                  judicial persecution more recently set in motion, under the
                  leadership of Corcuera himself, in order to intimidate and
                  silence the victims, and to safeguard the sacrosanct public
                  image of the criminal. On the other, it throws all the blame
                  on one isolated individual, as if the vast concurrence of
                  crimes he committed would have been possible without the
                  complicity of his closest advisors and, even more, without the
                  peculiar structure he bequeathed the organization, making it a
                  perfect machine of domination and cover-up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is most evident that what differentiates the Legionaries
                  from all the other religious orders is not only the personal
                  conduct of its founder: it is the whole organizational
                  conception of that entity, designed to serve goals that have
                  nothing to do with its nominal purpose, serving the latter
                  only to the extent they were useful to the former.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For what purpose would a religious discipline need to add to
                  the traditional vows of poverty, obedience and chastity, a
                  heretic and extravagant &#8220;vow of secrecy,&#8221; if not
                  to hide from the outset something intended to be hidden?
                </p>
                <p>
                  For what purpose would a Catholic religious order have to
                  adopt for its novices and lay faithful, besides the old and
                  established pedagogical and disciplinary methods, certain
                  behavior control techniques which originated in the
                  anti-Christian &#8220;New Age&#8221; movement and in social
                  engineering laboratories, engaged in building the world
                  civilization of the Antichrist?
                </p>
                <p>
                  For what purpose would a religious order need to establish,
                  besides the usual norms of respect and obedience, the
                  idolatrous worship of its leaders, who were flippantly
                  proclaimed as &#8220;saints&#8221; at first sight, without the
                  slightest critical examination, in outpourings of collective
                  hysterical emotionalism which blaspheme the very notion of
                  holiness?
                </p>
                <p>
                  For what purpose would a religious order need to practice
                  large scale imposition of forced vocations, allegedly revealed
                  by the Holy Spirit to the leaders of the organization and then
                  impinged on astonished youth as a mandate from heaven to which
                  they would never dare say &#8220;no&#8221;?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why would a religious order need to devote so much effort to
                  enticing rich laymen and to the speedy build-up of financial
                  and property holdings worth billions?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why would a religious order need to infiltrate parishes to
                  dominate them, disregarding the jurisdictions of parish
                  priests, and unlawfully constituting itself as an authority
                  higher than that of archdioceses themselves, up to the point
                  that some of these, in the United States, found themselves
                  forced to ban all contact between their parishes and the
                  invading organization? What kind of Catholicism is there in a
                  Gramscian &#8220;war of position&#8221; against Catholics by a
                  militant body soi-disant Catholic?
                </p>
                <p>
                  No, the Legionaries &#8211; who should more appropriately be
                  called the Millionaires &#8211; are not a normal religious
                  order, tarnished only by a malign individual who by chance, by
                  mere coincidence, happened to be its founder.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Legionaries are the very same perverse mentality of such
                  founder, transfigured into a worldwide machine of allurement,
                  psychological domination, manipulation of conduct, and
                  concealment of crimes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Church has no reason to ask forgiveness for the evil that
                  has been inflicted upon it from within by a
                  power-and-wealth-hungry group of psychopaths, but it also does
                  not have any reason to try to save face of an organization
                  that turned good into an instrument of evil. This evil must be
                  exposed in all its sinister grandeur, making it clear that it
                  was not practiced &#8220;by&#8221; the Church, but
                  <em>against</em> it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is simply not possible to preserve, at one and the same
                  time, the dignity of the Church and the reputation of the
                  Legionaries. I do not think this is what Benedict XVI wants,
                  but it is clear that both among the enemies of the faith and
                  in the upper hierarchy of the Church itself there are many
                  people interested in giving the impression that this is
                  precisely what he wants.
