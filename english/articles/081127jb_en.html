                  Joseph Farah, the editor of WorldNetDaily, says that only
                  three reasons can account for the cover-up operation set up to
                  deny the public Barack Hussein Obama&#8217;s documents: either
                  the guy was really born in Kenya and will not confess to being
                  ineligible, or he has something else to hide, or what he
                  intends to do is to break the backbone of the American nation,
                  spreading to the four corners of the earth that he, the
                  anointed by fate, lies above the Constitution, above the law,
                  above the right to information, and above national pride. It
                  is clear to me that the latter hypothesis, regardless of the
                  veracity or not of the other two, is not a hypothesis at all:
                  it is an absolute certainty. It expresses not what Obama
                  &#8220;intends&#8221; to do, but what he has already been
                  doing. To show himself in public with a biography full of
                  inconsistencies and to refuse haughtily to present any
                  explanation, any proof, any document is already an
                  exaggeration of petulance rarely seen. If Obama did that only
                  as a writer or a show business figure, it would already be an
                  at least disturbing case of megalomaniac autolatry. But to do
                  it at the very moment of his seeking the highest office,
                  extorting from the electorate a vote of confidence grounded on
                  blind faith, cannot be explained by mere insanity. Here is a
                  plan, a method, an inbuilt machiavellianism.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While the declared goals of the Obama presidency are cloudy
                  and contradictory, the tacit logic of his actions is quite
                  clear, and becomes even more evident by the massive presence
                  of Clintonians in his team. It is all about carrying on
                  faithfully Bill Clinton&#8217;s destructive work, inspired in
                  Scott Talbot&#8217;s formula: to foster with American
                  taxpayers&#8217; money the growth of rival powers and to
                  debilitate the military, economic, and diplomatic power of the
                  United States, selling the surrender to
                  &#8220;multilateralism&#8221; as if it were of the highest
                  national interest, while in internal politics the state
                  control over the citizens&#8217; lives is increased, and the
                  country&#8217;s cultural defenses are diluted into a
                  hallucinogenic potion made out of politically correct trash.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The greatest obstacle to the docile insertion of the United
                  States into the new globalist order is the American
                  Constitution. That is why the likes of Obama or Al Gore never
                  speak of it without snarling and giving a glimpse of their
                  intention to tear it to pieces. But to alter the Constitution,
                  just like that, would be too reckless. It is necessary to
                  create the cultural and psychological atmosphere which makes
                  the change acceptable. The classic method of doing so is to
                  impose ostensive disobedience as commonplace routine from the
                  upper classes down, desensitizing the public through the
                  peremptory denial that something abnormal may be going on.
                  This is precisely what the Democratic Party did throughout the
                  campaign. For this reason I foresaw that, even if Obama had
                  lost the election, he would have been the winner of the
                  arm-wrestling match against the Constitution: immunized by
                  racial blackmail and the media&#8217;s barefaced adulation,
                  not only was he exempted from the minimum of transparency
                  which no candidate before him had ever dared to evade, but
                  even the trivial request for a proof of identity on his part
                  began to be treated as a racial insult and a symptom of
                  paranoia, while his opponents, guilty until proven innocent,
                  were forced to explain themselves, with witnesses and
                  documents, even upon irrelevant details of their personal
                  lives. The Obama campaign debased and corrupted the American
                  electoral system to the point that conservatives themselves,
                  afraid of acknowledging the reality of the decay, averted
                  their eyes and consecrated by omission the normalcy of the
                  absurd. While they discussed the proposals and perils of a
                  possible Obama presidency, they blinded themselves to the
                  candidate&#8217;s actual behavior, which, without a word,
                  already put those proposals into execution with an
                  overpowering prepotency and an irreversible force. When the
                  faith in the soundness of institutions becomes a pretext for
                  not defending them against a real and immediate danger, it is
                  precisely because that soundness no longer exists, except as a
                  pretext.
