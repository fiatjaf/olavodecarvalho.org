          <p>
            Since word got out that I am writing a book called "The
            Revolutionary Mind", I have received many requests for a preliminary
            explanation of such phenomenon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The revolutionary mind is a perfectly identifiable and continuous
            historical phenomenon, whose developments over five centuries may be
            traced in countless documents. This is the subject of an
            investigation that has occupied me for several years now. It is not
            exactly a "book", as I have presented some of the results from my
            studies in classes, conferences and articles, and I am not sure if
            one day I will be able to reduce this huge material to a specific
            printed format. "The revolutionary mind" is the name of the subject,
            and not necessarily of one, or two or three books.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have never worried much about the editorial format of what I have
            to say. I investigate the issues that interest me and, when I arrive
            at some conclusions that seem reasonable to me, I pass them on,
            orally or in writing, as the occasion permits. To render my
            conclusions in a book format is a nuisance that, if I could, I would
            leave for an assistant to take care of. As I have no assistant, I am
            postponing this work while I can.
          </p>
          <p>
            The revolutionary mind is not essentially a political phenomenon,
            but a spiritual and psychological one, though its field of
            expression and its fundamental instrument is political action.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make things easier, I use the expressions "revolutionary mind"
            and "revolutionary mentality" in order to distinguish between the
            concrete historical phenomenon, with its varied manifestations, and
            the essential and permanent characteristic that enables one to grasp
            its unity throughout time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "revolutionary mentality" is the permanent or transitory state
            of spirit in which an individual or a group believes himself capable
            of remodeling the whole society � if not human nature in general �
            through political action. As an agent or bearer of a better future,
            he considers himself to be above all judgment by present or past
            humanity, being accountable only to the "court of History". But the
            court of History is, by definition, the very future society that
            this individual or group claims to represent in the present. So, as
            future society is only able to bear witness or to judge through this
            same representative, it is clear that he thus becomes not only the
            sole sovereign judge of his own acts, but the judge of all past,
            present and future humanity. Able to accuse and to condemn all laws,
            institutions, beliefs, values, traditions, actions and works of all
            epochs without being subject, in his turn, to the judgment of any of
            them, he lies so much above historical humanity that it would not be
            inaccurate to call him Superman.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the self-glorification of Superman, the revolutionary mentality
            is totalitarian and genocidal in itself, independently from its
            ideological content in different circumstances and occasions.
          </p>
          <p>
            By refusing himself to be accountable to anything except a
            hypothetical future of his own invention, and firmly disposed to
            destroy by cunning or by force every obstacle to the remodeling of
            the world to his own image and likeness, the revolutionary is the
            worst enemy of the human species, compared to whom the worst tyrants
            and conquerors of Antiquity impress us by the modesty of their aims
            and by a notable circumspection in the use of their means.
          </p>
          <p>
            The advent of the revolutionary to the foreground of historical
            scene � a phenomenon whose origins can be traced to around the XV th
            century, and which manifests itself with all clarity at the end of
            the XVIII th century � inaugurates the era of totalitarianism, world
            wars, and permanent genocide. Over a period of two centuries,
            revolutionary movements, the wars they undertook and the slaughter
            of civilian populations necessary to consolidate their grip on power
            have killed much more people than the sum of all wars, epidemics,
            earthquakes, and natural disasters of any kind since the beginning
            of world history.
          </p>
          <p>
            The revolutionary movement is the worst scourge to befall upon the
            human species since its advent on Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The expansion of genocidal violence and the imposition of ever more
            suffocating restrictions to human liberty have followed
            <em>pari passu </em> the dissemination of the revolutionary
            mentality among ever growing segments of the population. This way,
            entire masses attribute to themselves the role of avenging judges,
            appointed by the court of the future, and grant to themselves the
            right to practice infinitely bigger crimes than all those which the
            revolutionary promise purports to end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if we do not take into account deliberate killings and consider
            revolutionary performance only from the economic point of view, no
            other social or natural cause has ever generated so much misery and
            brought about so many deaths due to malnutrition as the
            revolutionary regimes in Russia, China, North Korea, and several
            African countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever the future of the human species and whatever personal
            conceptions we may have about it, the revolutionary mentality must
            be radically expelled from the repertoire of admitted social and
            cultural possibilities before, by so much forcing the birth of a
            supposedly better world, it turns it into a gigantic abortion,
            rendering the millennia-old journey of the human species on Earth a
            meaningless history crowned with a bloody ending.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the different revolutionary ideologies are, all of them, in
            greater or lesser degree, menacing and wicked, their evil does not
            rest so much in their specific content or in the strategies to bring
            it about, as in the very fact of them being revolutionary in the
            sense defined here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Socialism and Nazism are not revolutionary because they propose
            supremacy of a social class or of a race, but because they turn
            these goals into principles for a radical remodeling not only of the
            political order, but of all human life. The evil that they
            foreshadow becomes universally threatening because they do not
            present themselves as local answers to momentary situations, but as
            universal commandments instilled with the authority to remake the
            world according the mold of a hypothetical future perfection. The
            Ku-Klux-Klan is as racist as Nazism, but it is not revolutionary
            because is does not have any worldwide project. For this reason, it
            would be ridiculous to compare it, in terms of its dangerousness, to
            the Nazi movement. The KKK is a simply a police problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why it must be stressed that the meaning here given to the
            term "revolution" is at once more encompassing and more precise than
            the one generally attributed to it by historiography and by the
            current social sciences. Many socio-political processes usually
            called "revolutions" are not actually "revolutionary", because they
            do not partake of the revolutionary mentality, they do not aim at
            the total remodeling of society, culture and the human species, but
            work only to modify local and momentary situations, ideally for the
            better. For example, the political rebellion to severe ties between
            a country and another is not necessarily revolutionary, and neither
            is the mere overthrow of a tyrannical regime with the goal of
            bringing a nation to the level of freedoms already enjoyed by
            neighboring peoples. Even though such undertakings may employ large
            scale warfare resources and may cause spectacular transformation,
            they are not revolutions because they do not aspire to anything
            other than the correction of immediate evils or even the return to a
            previous situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            What truly characterizes the revolutionary movement is that it
            imposes the authority of a hypothetical future on the judgment of
            all the human species, present or past. By its very nature, the
            revolution is totalitarian and universally expansive: there is not a
            single aspect of human life that it does not intend to submit to its
            power, there is no region of the world where it does not wish to
            extend the tentacles of its influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, according to this definition, if on one hand the concept of
            "revolution" must exclude several politico-military movements of
            vast proportions, it must, on the other hand, include several
            apparently peaceful movements of a purely intellectual and cultural
            nature, whose evolution over time may turn them into political
            powers aimed at universally imposing new patterns of thought and
            conduct through bureaucratic, judicial and police means. In this
            sense, the Hungarian rebellion of 1956 or the overthrow of the
            Brazilian President Joao Goulart in 1964 were not, in any way,
            revolutions. Neither was the American Independence, a special case
            that I will have to deal with in another article. But there is no
            question that Darwinism and the set of pseudo-religious phenomena
            known as New Age are indeed revolutionary movements. All these
            distinctions will later be subject of separate explanations and are
            mentioned here only as a sample.

            Among the confusions that this study allows to elucidate is the one
            that dominates the concepts of the political "Left" and "Right".
            This confusion stems from the fact that these two words are used to
            designate two orders of entirely different phenomena. On one hand,
            the Left is the revolution in general and the Right is the
            counter-revolution. There seemed to be no doubt about this when
            these terms were used to designate the two wings of the
            <em>&Eacute;tats G&eacute;n&eacute;raux </em>in revolutionary France
            <em>. </em>But later developments led the revolutionary movement
            itself to appropriate both terms, and to use them to designate its
            own internal subdivisions. The Girondins <em>, </em> who sat to the
            left of the king, became the "right-wing" of the revolution, in the
            same way that, once the king was decapitated, supporters of the
            <em>Ancien R&eacute;gime </em> were banned from public life and had
            no right to their own political denomination. This retreat of what
            is admissible as "right-wing" by labeling as such one of the wings
            of the Left itself, became later a habitual device of the
            revolutionary process. At the same time, the remaining genuine
            counter-revolutionaries were often forced to ally themselves with
            the revolutionary "Right" and to assimilate themselves to it in
            order to preserve some means of action in the aftermath of the
            victorious revolution. To complicate things even more, once
            counter-revolution was excluded from the repertoire of politically
            admissible ideas, counter-revolutionary resentment continued to
            exist as a psycho-social phenomenon, and was many times used by the
            revolutionary Left as a pretext and a rhetorical appeal to win for
            its cause sectors of the population who, though deeply conservative
            and traditionalist, revolted against the revolutionary "Right"
            dominant at that moment. The appeal of the Brazilian Landless
            Workers' Movement (MST) to rural nostalgia or the
            pseudo-traditionalist rhetoric employed here and there by Fascism
            make us forget the strictly revolutionary disposition of these
            movements. Mao Zedong himself was for some time considered to be a
            traditionalist land reformer. It is needless to add that, in the
            internal disputes in the revolutionary movement, the warring
            factions often accuse each other of being a "right-winger" (or
            "reactionary"). As with the Nazi rhetoric that intended to destroy
            at once "reaction" and "Communism", the Communist side employed a
            double and successive discourse which first treated the Nazis as
            primitive and anarchic revolutionaries and then as members of the
            "reaction" devoted to "saving Capitalism" against the proletarian
            revolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The terms "Left" and "Right" only have a meaning when used in their
            original sense of revolution and counter-revolution respectively.
            All their other combinations and meanings are occasional
            arrangements that do not have any descriptive power, but retain
            casual usefulness as symbols of the unity of a political movement
            and as demonizing signs of its objects of hatred.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the U.S., the term "Right" is used to describe both conservatives
            in a strict sense, who are viscerally anti-revolutionary, and
            globalist Republicans, the "right-wing" of world revolution. But
            much worse is the confusion reigning in Brazil, where the
            counter-revolutionary Right does not have political existence and
            the word "right-winger" is used by the ruling (leftist) party to
            designate any opposition it encounters, even within leftist parties,
            whereas the leftist opposition uses it to label the ruling party
            itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is clear for me that it is only possible to return some objective
            descriptive power to these terms if we take, as a delimiting line,
            the revolutionary movement as a whole, and oppose to it the
            counter-revolutionary Right, even where it does not have political
            expression and is only a cultural phenomenon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The essence of the counter-revolutionary or conservative mentality
            is the aversion to any project of encompassing transformation, the
            obstinate refusal to intervening in society as a whole, the
            quasi-religious respect to regional, spontaneous and long-term
            political processes, the denial of all authority to the spokesmen of
            the hypothetical future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this sense, the author of these lines is strictly conservative.
            Among other motives, because he believes that only the conservative
            viewpoint can provide a realistic view of the historical process, as
            it is based on past experience and not in conjectures about the
            future. All revolutionary historiography is fraudulent from its
            foundation, because it interprets and distorts the past according to
            a mold of a hypothetical and indefinable future. It is not a
            coincidence that the greatest historians of all time have always
            been conservative.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, considered in itself and in the values it fights for, the
            counter-revolutionary mentality must be appropriately called
            "conservative", it is obvious that, from the point of view of its
            relations with the enemy, it is strictly "reactionary". To be
            reactionary is to react in the most inflexible and hostile fashion
            to the devilish ambition of dominating the world.
