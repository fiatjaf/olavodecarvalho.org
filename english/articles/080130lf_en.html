            <p>The dominant discourse in the mainstream media, show business and 
              universities in the USA today is so frankly anti-American that it 
              is only in details of style - if that - that it can be distinguished 
              from the defamation campaigns undertaken by the USSR in the 50s 
              and 60s. The American elite boasts of having won the Cold War, but 
              it seems as if it was dominated psychologically by the vanquished 
              enemy and wound up believing everything the enemy said against it. 
              The posthumous vengeance of the Soviets gleams in the pages of the 
              New York Times, at prime time on CBS, and in the films by Michael 
              Moore and George Clooney with a splendor that not even Willi Muenzenberg, 
              the genius of communist disinformation, would have dared dream of.
            <p>Whatever is said against the American government, against the American 
              military, and against American culture, seems to enjoy automatic 
              credibility today, so much so that it can be shouted from the rooftops 
              without the least fear of an exasperated response, to the extent 
              that any pro-American word must be prefaced with politically correct 
              precautions for fear of the inevitable and vociferous retaliation, 
              if not of a lawsuit. To follow the American debate is to confirm 
              daily the prophetic sense of the verse by William Butler Yeats: 
              &#8220;the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of 
              passionate intensity.&#8221; Something has changed radically in 
              the heart of America in the second half of the 20th century, and 
              has changed precisely in the direction in which the country&#8217;s 
              bitterest enemies would have wanted it to change.</p>
            <p>How was this possible? The agents of change want us to believe 
              that it was all a spontaneous, natural and inevitable process, lending 
              the course of the transformation the authority of an impersonal 
              historic law that only the small minded reactionary would dare to 
              question. But many years ago I realized that impersonal laws of 
              history are almost always mere camouflage for human actions that 
              want to pass unperceived so that their effects take on an aura of 
              divine mystery.</p>
            <p>The change that weakened the American soul was precipitated by 
              three major disinformation operations that, because they were launched 
              from Washington and not from Moscow, managed to deceive the entire 
              nation and forge a new &#8220;common sense&#8221; (in the Gramscian 
              sense of the word), whose influence not even the most conservative 
              and patriotic completely escape. On these three occasions, the lies 
              carefully elaborated by the government itself to cast onto the United 
              States the blame for the malicious actions of its enemies not only 
              became official truth, uniformly repeated today by the media and 
              the education system, but spread around the world, creating the 
              monstrously deformed image that today feeds and legitimizes anti-American 
              hatred everywhere. It may seem absurd that government officials 
              would choose to participate in the defamation of their own country 
              to avoid problems with the USSR or to save their own electoral image, 
              but that is exactly what three American presidents did, two of which, 
              ironically, are portrayed by leftist rhetoric as exemplary embodiments 
              of anti-communism and &#8220;Yankee imperialism.&#8221;</p>
            <p>The three operations were conceived in the high spheres of the 
              Democratic Party, but at least one of them had intense Republican 
              collaboration. Three recently published books, one of which I already 
              commented on here and the other I mentioned in passing, finally 
              reveal what happened behind the scenes on these occasions, the incredible 
              machinations of politicians and journalists, who for the sake of 
              short-term gains, unhesitatingly favored the enemy and bequeathed 
              to future generations an increasingly morally weakened country.</p>
            <p>The first of these episodes was the operation carried out by the 
              Truman administration &#8212; and faithfully pursued by Eisenhower 
              &#8212; to deny or cover up the massive presence of Soviet agents 
              in high posts of the American government, particularly in the State 
              Department, and also in technical and administrative functions, 
              where they had access to secret information of a military nature.</p>
            <p>This story is told in detail with extensive documentation by M. 
              Stanton Evans in &#8220;Black Listed by History. The Untold Story 
              of Senator Joseph MacCarthy and His Fight against America&#8217;s 
              Enemies,&#8221; New York, Crown forum 2007. If you can&#8217;t read 
              the book, you can listen to a good resume presented by the author 
              at the Heritage Foundation, with a commentary by Herbert Rommerstein, 
              the one personally responsible for major investigations into Soviet 
              infiltration in the USA (see <a href="http://www.heritage.org/press/events/ev121207a.cfm">Blacklisted 
              by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy</a>).</p>
            <p>To get an idea of the strategic risks involved in this situation, 
              suffice to say that practically the entire tone of North American 
              policy in China during the communist revolution was set on the basis 
              of reports fabricated by Soviet agents who infiltrated the American 
              diplomatic service in Beijing. By means of prodigious falsifications, 
              these agents managed to persuade the Washington government to withhold 
              needed aid from their ally Chiang Kai-shek and support the communist 
              troops of Mao Zedong, who without this would never have managed 
              to overthrow the Chinese government and install the bloodiest of 
              genocidal dictatorships the world had ever known. American Ambassador 
              Patrick Hurley saw through the ruse and warned Washington in time, 
              but his messages were ignored. Feeling sullied, Hurley asked to 
              be relieved of his post and was replaced by General George Marshall, 
              who believed in these stories as if they had been revealed gospel. 
              Marshall was not procommunist, obviously, but if his behavior in 
              this case was not a clear-cut example of what Eric Voegelin called 
              &#8220;criminal stupidity,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what could 
              fit that category. Following the record genocide of 70 million people, 
              the Chinese government, having accumulated atomic bombs with the 
              money generously supplied by American investors, is today the number 
              one security risk for the USA.</p>
            <p>Alerted to these and other innumerable cases of Soviet infiltration, 
              the Truman administration opted to kill the messenger, and did everything 
              it could to give the impression that the only serious danger for 
              America was anti-communism, particularly that of Senator Joe McCarthy, 
              whose demonized image still remains vivid in world memory. To obtain 
              this result, Harry Truman&#8217;s shock troops unhesitatingly covered 
              up the essential documents, which, revealed only now, show that, 
              in essence, all the accusations made by McCarthy were true and even 
              modest in comparison to the real dimensions of the problem. Besides 
              suppressing evidence and protecting itself behind false testimonies, 
              the Truman administration, instead of dismissing the suspects, preferred 
              to support their careers, enabling them to rise in the hierarchy 
              and continue offering services to the Soviet dictatorship with American 
              taxpayer money.</p>
            <p>An entire culture of anti-McCarthyism, supported by textbooks, 
              cinema and journalism, grew out of this enterprise of intentional 
              falsification. The consequences of this extend to the present day, 
              making Americans, repenting of sins they never committed against 
              communists, sense greater fear of a possible &#8220;return to the 
              McCarthy era&#8221; than of a joint assault of Chinese generals 
              and Islamic radicals.</p>
            <p>I see the second episode of the series when Lee Harvey Oswald killed 
              President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Not only the White 
              House but also the CIA and the FBI knew that Oswald was a fanatical 
              communist and that his intention in shooting Kennedy was to frustrate 
              any American initiative against Fidel Castro&#8217;s dictatorship. 
              Chilled at the prospects of a national outbreak of anti-Communist 
              revolt targeting the Democratic Party and reviving suspicions of 
              the Harry Truman era, President Lyndon Johnson did what he could 
              to turn the attention of the Warren Commission away from this sensitive 
              point, explaining Oswald&#8217;s crime not as the result of his 
              ideological convictions but of generic motivations such as emotional 
              instability, family problems, etc. As unbelievable as it seems, 
              the commission agreed to analyze the most famous political homicide 
              of the 20th century without mentioning politics. Coming to the president&#8217;s 
              aid, the chic media and enlightened intellectuals then produced 
              a copious literature of pseudo-sociological claims that placed the 
              blame for the crime on the &#8220;American culture of violence&#8221; 
              and other vapid generalities which, in their final conclusion, were 
              laid to the charge of conservatives. The anti-American discourse 
              of the new left, which was then starting to gain prominence, thus 
              received powerful backing from the very government of Washington 
              at which it directed its hysterical eloquence. This discourse wound 
              up incorporating itself in &#8220;common sense,&#8221; to the point 
              that today it is routinely repeated by the mainstream media without 
              anyone noticing anything out of place. The book that described this 
              enormous psychological mutation that was born in the highest spheres 
              in Washington and spread throughout the American culture is Camelot 
              and the Cultural Revolution. How the Assassination of John F. Kennedy 
              Shattered American liberalism, by James Pierson (New York, Encounter 
              Books, 2007).</p>
            <p>The biggest irony in all of this is that Lee Oswald, a convert 
              to communism since adolescence, could in no way be considered representative 
              of the reactionary trends supposedly responsible for the &#8220;American 
              violence&#8221; that would have prompted him to homicide, much less 
              the fanatical Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan, who in 1968, assassinated 
              the ex-president&#8217;s brother, Robert Kennedy. It is not by coincidence 
              that we now know Yasser Arafat&#8217;s Palestinian Authority was 
              from head to toe a brainchild of the KGB (<a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/comartin/israel/pacepa-wsj.html">http://www.weizmann.ac.il/home/comartin/israel/pacepa-wsj.html</a>), 
              but at the time, this tireless myth factory of the leftist elite 
              was able to make two crimes committed by procommunist agents against 
              two notoriously anti-Communist politicians appear to be the handiwork 
              of the &#8220;reactionary right,&#8221; and to have this rigorously 
              inverted version of reality embed itself in the American psyche 
              so deeply that it would take many decades to uproot it, if indeed 
              it were at all possible.</p>
            <p>The third big lie, also definitively incorporated in the rituals 
              of America&#8217;s pseudo-moralistic masochism was also the work 
              of Lyndon Johnson. After having hampered the action of American 
              troops in Vietnam by all possible means, Johnson drew the logical 
              conclusion from his own strategy, transfiguring the victory into 
              a defeat. On January 31, 1968, the North Vietnamese army of Ho Chi 
              Minh launched a major offensive against the Americans and South 
              Vietnamese. The idea was to occupy all at once the cities of South 
              Vietnam, starting with the capital, Saigon, instigating a general 
              uprising with the help of Vietcong fighters. Militarily, the offensive 
              was a monumental failure. The Communists lost, in a few days, 50,000 
              soldiers and all the objectives that they had conquered. Even the 
              famous attack on the American embassy in Saigon was a failure. Not 
              a single Vietcong was able to enter the building &#8212; they all 
              died at the gate. Meanwhile, since the American army followed the 
              standard procedure for such occasions, quickly evacuating the civil 
              servants by means of helicopters on the embassy rooftop, the images 
              of the evacuation were shown on American TV as evidence of general 
              panic and a sure sign of the imminent defeat of South Vietnam. When 
              President Johnson saw these scenes being interpreted this way by 
              veteran TV news commentator Walter Cronkite, he reasoned &#8220;if 
              I&#8217;ve lost Cronkite I&#8217;ve lost the nation.&#8221; The 
              North Vietnamese commander, General Giap, showed how right that 
              was when he admitted that his main weapon against South Vietnam 
              was the American media. By endorsing the legend of the American 
              defeat, Johnson brought down on his country a humiliation that the 
              elegant media and prattling intellectuals have been celebrating 
              incessantly since then as a just punishment meted out to the reactionary, 
              fanatical and violent people who persecuted innocents in the MacCarthy 
              era and assassinated two Kennedys&#8230;</p>
            <p>Only now, with the first volume of the book consecrated to the 
              Vietnam War by historian Mark Moyar is the reality of the victory 
              artificially disguised as a defeat beginning to appear. Read &#8216;Triumph 
              Forsaken. The Vietnam War 1954-1964? (Cambridge University press, 
              2006).</p>
            <p>No other country in the world has had as many traitors per square 
              mile as the USA. All of the anti-American mythology circulating 
              in the world originated in Washington and New York &#8212; with 
              nothing more than initial light shoves him from the KGB. The fact 
              that the USA managed to survive such devastating lies hurled against 
              the country by its own government officials and its most renowned 
              intellectual leaders is something that can be explained only by 
              the residual persistence of the people&#8217;s fondness for American 
              traditions. It is true that we Brazilians need not come to North 
              America to learn about a good people governed by swindlers. But 
              the nagging question in my mind is whether these swindlers in Brazil 
              would have risen as high as they did without the aid of the swindlers 
              in Washington.</p>
