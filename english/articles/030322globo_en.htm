            <i>O Globo</i>, March 22nd, 2003
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In 1995, I expounded in &#147;O Jardim das
            Afli&ccedil;&otilde;es&#148; (&#147;The Garden of Afflictions&#148;)
            the theory that the new worldwide Empire that was being formed
            concurrently with economic globalization was a phenomenon rather
            different from anything that had been known up to then as
            &#147;imperialism&#148;. Notwithstanding the praise received from
            both domestic and foreign critics, the book remained marginalized,
            never being cited in any prevailing discussions, whether in the
            media or in the academic realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Five years later, Mr. Antonio Negri earned quite a bit of money and
            widespread applause selling the same theory in his book
            &#147;Empire&#148;, co-authored by Michael Hardt. Mr. Negri&#146;s
            concordance with me starts at the beginning of the process, which
            dates back to the 18th century, and continues up to the explicit
            localization of the seat of imperial government, which we both
            placed in the United Nations building, and not in the White House.
            Between these two extremes, we also agreed on the definition of the
            Empire as a new civilizational paradigm and not just a mutation of
            old imperialisms and colonialisms.
          </p>
          <p>
            It never occurred to me that Mr. Negri, whom I don&#146;t know from
            Adam, had plagiarized me. He just had a slower brain, which
            wasn&#146;t his fault, and I didn&#146;t have a marketing lobby
            working for me, which wasn&#146;t my fault. Other essential
            differences between us are as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            1) I could not claim among my intellectual merits participation in a
            political homicide, whereas Mr. Negri lists among his
            accomplishments his thoughtful cooperation with the assassins of
            Aldo Moro &#150; which, let&#146;s face it, has an irresistible sex
            appeal to the ostensibly cultured press.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) Mr. Negri described as centers of libertarian reaction to the
            imperial ascension exactly those mass movements in which I saw the
            unmistakable hand of the Empire itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) Mr. Negri, loyal to the Marxist habit of explaining everything in
            terms of economics, saw the Empire as a political superstructure of
            globalized capitalism, and thus could not help but end up making the
            U.N., at least implicitly, an agency at the service of capitalism.
            Since most of the capital is in the U.S., the result was that the
            diagnosis which distinguished between imperialism and Empire ended
            up disproving itself and being exposed as nothing more than a new
            pretext to cudgel the U.S.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have no argument regarding the first point, where Mr. Negri&#146;s
            superiority is indisputable. As far as the second, the giant
            worldwide &#147;pacifist&#148; movement in support of Saddam Hussein
            shows with global eloquence that mass movements in which Mr. Negri
            saw a &#147;utopian alternative&#148; to the U.N. Empire (and his
            co-author Hardt still insists on this, with blind obstinacy, in the
            March 19th <i>Folha de S&atilde;o Paulo</i>) are tentacles of the
            U.N. itself, working to strangle the last remaining national
            sovereignties capable of creating problems for it: American,
            British, and Israeli.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, events of recent weeks (actually, of recent years, that is,
            since the Durban conference) have proven clearly which side the U.N.
            is on. Furthermore, they have shown which side American
            neoglobalists are on, including the mainstream media: at the service
            of the U.N. and against their own country.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I explained in &#147;The Garden of Afflictions&#148;, there is
            within the U.S. a basic conflict between imperial and national
            forces, or between adherents of the U.N. and those of the American
            nation, the latter aligned with Israel, the former with the
            worldwide revolution which today unites Communists, neo-Nazis,
            Islamic radicals and various two-bit anti-American interests in a
            global pact of support for the genocidal tyranny in Iraq, and, in
            general, of everything rotten in the world. In short, all that is
            really useful in Mr. Negri&#146;s book are the parts in which it
            coincides with mine. All the rest is imperious propaganda
            camouflaged as &#147;alternative utopia&#148;.
          </p>
          <p>
            One subject I did not bring up in my book and which is too long to
            discuss here is: how did revolutionary Islam become the funnel
            through which all anti-American and antidemocratic currents now
            flow? To sum it up bluntly, and promising to come back to the
            subject someday, let me say that:
          </p>
          <p>
            1) Islamic radicalism, the product of European-educated Muslim
            intellectuals, and which dates back to the &#146;30s, is to
            traditional Islam what liberation theology is to Christianity. It
            empties the Islamic tradition from its spiritual content and
            transmutes it into the ideological formula of world revolution.
            President Bush, whom our semi-literate intellectuals try to dismiss
            as a hick, understood this point perfectly, and vehemently refused
            the indecent proposal of giving the war against terrorism the
            connotation of an anti-Islamic crusade.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) This formula, because of its universalist character and its
            enviable dialectical refinement (after all, one of its creators is
            Roger Garaudy, accomplished Hegelian scholar), brings together and
            transcends all the anticapitalist and antidemocratic currents of the
            twentieth century, from rank Nazism &#150; passing through its more
            refined versions, such as the anti-humanism of Martin Heidegger, the
            deconstructionism of Paul de Man, the nihilism of Foucault &#150; to
            the diverse forms of communism: Stalinist, Maoist, Trotskyist,
            Gramscian, etc. As its pioneer Said Qutub has prophesied, the
            destiny of the Islamic revolution is to absorb and surpass &#150; in
            Hegelian fashion &#150; all other revolutions. Thus the apparent
            miracle of solidarity between leftists and neo-Nazis at the
            anti-Bush protests, and the anti-Israeli intrigues of the U.N.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, embarking on a life-and-death struggle against the
            worldwide revolution &#150; and indirectly, against the neoglobalism
            of the U.N. &#150; the American nation itself is taking on imperial
            responsibilities. What could come to be an American Empire, born
            from the rubble of the revolutionary project and the virtual cadaver
            of the U.N., is something that will only begin to become clear from
            here on. Neither I nor Mr. Antonio Negri know in advance what it
            will be like, and that is the fourth and final difference between
            us: he thinks he does know.
