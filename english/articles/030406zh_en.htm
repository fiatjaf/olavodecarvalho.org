        <i>Zero Hora</i>, April 6th, 2003</p> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>Although I was invited to take part in the F&oacute;rum da Liberdade (Forum of Liberty), I will not be able to be there for a very simple reason: two Internet sites, <a href="http://www.comunismo.com.br">www.comunismo.com.br</a> and <a href="http://www.midiaindependente.org/">&#147;M&iacute;dia Independente&#148;</a> &#150; the later a millionaire NGO with branches in hundreds of countries &#150; are both promoting a public campaign for the physical annihilation of myself, and under such circumstances I must stay in Rio de Janeiro to take the necessary legal measures.</p> 
      <p>&#147;Summary execution, with no right to defense&#148; &#150; demands one of those sites, while the other informs the place where I can be found and suggests: &#147;Don&#146;t you think it&#146;s about time to bring a physical end to this cancer called Olavo de Carvalho?&#148; (more details in English at <a href="/english/">www.olavodecarvalho.org/english</a> or in Portuguese at <a href="http://www.olavodecarvalho.org">www.olavodecarvalho.org</a>.)</p> 
      <p>All this may seem exaggerated, but it is very natural that it should happen in an age and time when the very government, instead of protecting the people from the agents of the Farc who have been dominating the national violence industry, would rather protect the Farc from the risk of being called &#147;terrorist&#148; by the evil president of Colombia.</p> 
      <p>But there is something happening that is even more criminal than this call for homicide: it is the effort of the media to hide the most important news of the year: deputy Alberto Fraga (PMDB-DF) has announced in Parliament that he has definite proof that the PT was sponsored by the Farc in the last Federal and States elections. Although the deputy has already collected 86 signatures for a request for a CPI<sup><a name="1" href="#nota1">1</a></sup>, nothing about that is published in the newspapers or on TV. Probably it will not be mentioned in the F&oacute;rum da Liberdade, which, due to the lack of support from companies, was reduced to the kind of self-castrated opposition which is indeed the only one that fits a country governed by Fidel Castro&#146;s partners.</p> 
      <p>Meanwhile, the Brazilian government confesses that the leaders of the Farc are comfortably installed in national territory and, of course, nothing is done to disturb the peace of such VIP visitors, who are responsible, according to their partner Beira-Mar<sup><a name="2" href="#nota2">2</a></sup>, for the supply of two hundred tons of cocaine per year to the Brazilian market. To speak of the &#147;colombiazation&#148; of Brazil, in view of these facts, is optimism: In Colombia, the Farc are outlaws; in Brazil they are under the protection of the law.</p> 
      <p>Surely not only of the law. If, on the one hand, the articulation of the continental narcoguerrilla with muslim terrorism is more than proved by the presence of representatives of the latter in the Hugo Chavez government and in the Threefold Frontier<sup><a name="3" href="#nota3">3</a></sup>, the media, on the other, is dedicated to a strong campaign to demonize the anglo-american troups and save the face of Saddam Hussein&#146;s regime, shelter and fortress to so many terrorist organizations.</p> 
      <p>It is logical too that Mr. Luiz Eduardo Soares, one of the stars of the F&oacute;rum da Liberdade this year, and a servant himself to the world revolution, will hardly be annoyed with mentions of such unpleasant themes, but will be left at ease to repeat the official theory according to which misery and unemployment create, via miraculous and incomprehensible means, the billion-dollar machine of narcotrafficking and kidnapping, all of which is articulated politically in the Foro de S&atilde;o Paulo, an entity founded and lead by our President of the Republic.<sup><a name="4" href="#nota4">4</a></sup></p> 
      <p>There was a time in which I would not miss for anything in the world the chance to squeeze Mr. Luiz Eduardo with the questions that will not be put to him in my absence. But at the moment I can&#146;t: I&#146;m too busy trying to save my skin, and I do not believe to be far away the day my readers will find themselves identically uncomfortable.</p>

        <li><a name="nota1">A</a> Brazilian CPI (&#147;Comiss&atilde;o Parlamentar de Inqu&eacute;rito&#148;) is a comission that investigates political crimes.

        <li><a name="nota2">Beira-Mar</a> is an extremely periculous Brazilian drug dealer. Altough he is currently arrested, his power among the crime organizations remains very high, to a point that he has already been moved from one State to another many times in an effort to break his leadership. &#150; Editor&#146;s Note. <a href="#2">Back</a></li>
