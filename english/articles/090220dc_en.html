                  The billionaire festivities commemorating the 200th
                  anniversary of Charles Darwin&#8217;s birth make some
                  essential facts about the life and works of this man of
                  science momentarily invisible.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To begin with, Darwin did not invent the theory of evolution:
                  He found it ready-made, under the form of an esoteric
                  doctrine, in the work of his own grandfather, Erasmus Darwin,
                  and as a scientific hypothesis in innumerable mentions
                  scattered in books by Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Saint Thomas
                  Aquinas, and Goethe, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All he did was to venture a new explanation for that
                  theory&#8212;and his explanation was wrong. No one else, among
                  the self-proclaimed Darwin&#8217;s disciples, believes in
                  &#8220;natural selection.&#8221; The theory in vogue, the
                  so-called neo-Darwinism, proclaims that, instead of a
                  selection mysteriously oriented toward the improvement of the
                  species, all that happened were random changes. As far as I
                  know, mere chance is precisely the opposite of a rationally
                  expressible regularity founded on natural law. Darwinism is a
                  slippery and proteiform idea, with which one cannot seriously
                  discuss: as soon as it is pushed against a wall by a new
                  objection, it does not defend itself&#8212;it changes its
                  identity and walks away crowing about victory. Many theories
                  worshipped by the moderns do this, but Darwinism is the only
                  one that is barefaced enough to transform itself into its
                  contrary and go on proclaiming it is still the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All the celebrants of the Darwinian ritual, the new-Darwinists
                  inclusive, reject as pseudoscientific the theory of
                  &#8220;intelligent design.&#8221; But it was Charles Darwin
                  himself who made up this theory. It becomes very clear in the
                  final paragraphs of <em>The Origin of Species</em>, which I
                  read from cover to cover in my teenage years with so much
                  enchantment and which made me a fanatic Darwinist, to the
                  point that I hung a picture of the author on my bedroom wall,
                  surrounded by dinosaurs (only now I realize that he is one of
                  them). Now, thanks to the kindness of a reader, I got
                  acquainted with the studies of John Angus Campbell on the
                  &#8220;rhetoric of science.&#8221; He studies scientific books
                  from the vantage point of their strategy of persuasion. In a
                  fascinating video that you can see at
                  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_esXHcinOdA"
                    >http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_esXHcinOdA</a
                  >, he demonstrates that &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; is
                  not only the final touch of the Darwinist theory, but also its
                  fundamental premise, discreetly spread throughout the whole
                  argumentative edifice of <em>The Origin of Species</em>.
                  &#8220;Intelligent design&#8221; is therefore the only part of
                  the Darwinian theory that still has advocates: and those are
                  the worst enemies of Darwinism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is certainly a paradox that the author of a false
                  explanation for a preexistent theory should be celebrated as
                  the creator of this theory, though an even greater paradox is
                  that the founding premise of the Darwinian argument should be
                  repelled as the very denial of Darwinism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Purely farcical, however, is the general attempt to camouflage
                  the genocidal ideology that is embedded in the very internal
                  logic of the theory of evolution. When the apologists of the
                  British scientist acknowledge, against their will, that
                  evolution was &#8220;used&#8221; to legitimize racism and mass
                  murders, they do so with a monstrous hypocrisy. Darwinism is
                  genocidal by itself, from its very roots. It did not have to
                  be deformed by disloyal disciples to become something it was
                  not. Just read the following paragraphs by Charles Darwin and
                  tell me honestly whether racism and apology of genocide had to
                  be grafted onto an innocent theory afterwards:
                </p>
                <p>
                  &#8220;At some future period, not very distant as measured by
                  centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly
                  exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the
                  world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes. . . will no
                  doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest
                  allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man
                  in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the
                  Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now
                  between the negro or Australian and the gorilla&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Imagine if, during the American presidential elections, John
                  McCain&#8217;s campaign declared that Barack Hussein Obama was
                  closer to the gorilla than the republican candidate!
                </p>
                <p>
                  And there is more: &#8220;Looking to the world at no very
                  distant date, what an endless number of the lower races will
                  have been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout
                  the world!&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>
                  To finish the point, an unequivocal appeal to the
                  extermination of the undesirable:
                </p>
                <p>
                  &#8220;With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon
                  eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous
                  state of health. We civilized men, on the other hand, do our
                  utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums
                  for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute
                  poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to
                  save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason
                  to believe that vaccination has preserved thousands, who from
                  a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to smallpox.
                  Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their
                  kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic
                  animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the
                  race of man. It is surprising how soon a want of care, or care
                  wrongly directed, leads to the degeneration of a domestic
                  race; but excepting in the case of man himself, hardly anyone
                  is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Notice well: I am not against the evolutionist hypothesis.
                  From what I have observed thus far, I must conclude that I am
                  the only human being, in my inner and outer circle, who does
                  not have the least idea whether evolution happened or not.
                  Everyone has beliefs about it and seems willing to die or kill
                  for them. I have none.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, my abstinence from opinion with regard to a problem
                  that I consider unsolvable does not forbid me to perceive the
                  absurdity of the opinions of those who hold one. I understood
                  a long time ago that scientists are even less trustworthy than
                  politicians, and the paradoxes of Charles Darwin&#8217;s fame
                  do nothing but confirm it. My malign instincts compel me to
                  grab Darwinists by the throat and ask them:
                </p>
                <p>
                  &quot;Why so much fuss about Charles Darwin? He invented
                  &#8220;intelligent design&#8221;, which you hate, and natural
                  selection, which you say is false. He overtly preached racism
                  and genocide, which you proclaim to abhor. To celebrate him,
                  you must create out of nothing a fictitious character that is
                  the opposite of whom he was historically. Can&#8217;t you see
                  that all of this is just buffoonery?&quot;<br />
