                  At the time of this writing, the Republican Party is torn
                  between Baptist pastor Mike Huckabee and war veteran John
                  McCain.&nbsp; The Democrats have not yet decided between
                  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; The American electoral
                  picture is thus divided between three enigmas and a
                  frightening certainty.&nbsp; No one has the faintest idea of
                  what to expect from the first three should they be elected,
                  but the last has the resume necessary to complete the job of
                  dismantling the American presidency, a job that was started
                  with brilliant success by her husband with the aid of Chinese
                  spies, thieving lobbyists, Miss Monica Lewinsky, and drug
                  dealers of the FARC � who struck it rich with the famous
                  Colombia Plan � and last but not least, a plethora of
                  intelligence agents placed in the CIA to serve the Clinton
                  family instead of the American state.&nbsp; The major
                  advantage in favor of Hillary Clinton is that, as Paulo
                  Francis would say, everyone had already seen this movie and
                  knew who would die at the end.&nbsp; At a time of such
                  uncertainty, this could generate some votes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Huckabee presents himself as the �social conservative,� but at
                  the same time supports stem-cell research, putting his voters
                  in a major quandary.&nbsp; What he has in his favor is that
                  nothing as catastrophic is expected of him as is of the other
                  three.&nbsp; If he manages to prove he is harmless, he might
                  still have a chance against McCain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only John McCain knows what is going on inside his head. He
                  has already proven he is capable of changing his mind in an
                  instant and throttling forthwith anyone who opposes the
                  change.&nbsp; Conservatives say he is the most Democratic of
                  the Republicans, that he is impossible to clearly distinguish
                  from Senator Ted Kennedy, and that he can scarcely suppress an
                  orgasm whenever he sees a tax increase; but on the left there
                  are those who swear he is to the right of George W. Bush, that
                  he is the hawk's hawk, and the first thing he will do in the
                  presidency is bomb Iran and unleash World War III (or
                  IV).&nbsp; Perhaps all of this is true, but certainly, none of
                  it is good.&nbsp; Of the four candidates, he is still the one
                  best positioned to be elected, but it is a sure thing that
                  many of his constituents will vote for him in fear and
                  trembling, realizing they are doing so only to prevent one of
                  the parties from dominating the presidency along with the
                  Senate, the House and the majority vote in the Supreme Court,
                  making it omnipotent (Americans instinctively hate this).
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for Senator Obama, he is certainly less interesting than
                  the reasons many Americans have for voting for him.&nbsp; If
                  someone is constantly accused of a defect to the point of
                  developing a complex about it, he will most likely wind up
                  with the opposite defect.&nbsp; If applied skillfully, the
                  trick is almost foolproof.&nbsp; Accuse a guy of being a
                  skinflint and he will become a compulsive spendthrift.&nbsp;
                  Accuse him of being a male chauvinist and he will wind up
                  being henpecked.&nbsp; While racism in the USA has been a very
                  geographically limited phenomenon, the whole country has been
                  accused so much of racism that Americans in general wound up
                  sacrificing their dignity to a grotesque fad of political
                  correctness.&nbsp; And now many of them feel obliged to vote
                  for Barak Hussein Obama only to show that they are nice.&nbsp;
                  The senator speaks beautifully, but so far no one has been
                  able to discern in his discourse anything that remotely
                  resembles an issue.&nbsp; In the most substantive scenario,
                  there appears to be some promise of a campaign similar to that
                  of his opponent Hillary Clinton, if not that of the Republican
                  candidates.&nbsp; Like McCain, he promises to deliver Osama
                  bin Laden's head, that is, of course, if he can find it.&nbsp;
                  Like Mrs. Clinton, he promises free medical care for everyone
                  (not only for the poor, handicapped and aged), but without
                  ever thinking of explaining from whom he will get the money to
                  do this, or for that matter, how he will fill the gap in the
                  budget, which is already reckoned in the trillions.&nbsp; The
                  senator has specialized in adolescent exhortations of the type
                  �we're going to change the world,� because he knows that no
                  one expects him to actually do something in the presidency,
                  only that he'll be there as a symbol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A symbol of what?&nbsp; The ancient Latins said nomen est omen
                  , �the name is prophecy.�&nbsp; Barak Hussein means �blessed
                  descendent of the Prophet,� and there is conclusive evidence
                  that its bearer is lying when he says he was never a Muslim
                  (Daniel Pipes made that clear
                  <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/article/5286">here </a>
                  and
                  <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/article/5354">here </a>)
                  .&nbsp; It is more or less as if, in the midst of the Vietnam
                  war, the USA had elected as its president a guy named John
                  Paul Ho Chi Minh, educated in Hanoi, the son of a party
                  member, who swore he had never been a Communist and became
                  offended when anyone doubted it.&nbsp; Obama's candidacy is a
                  calculated provocation, serving as a gauge to assess the depth
                  of the acquired habit of politically correct self-censorship
                  now infused in the minds of Americans willing to be thrown
                  into the oven to avoid offending the cook.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A significant detail illustrates this to a tee: when the
                  senator listens to the national anthem, he does not place his
                  right hand on his heart as protocol demands but literally
                  shields his private parts with both hands, and everyone feels
                  too inhibited to say that this is an insult.&nbsp; A similar
                  test was conducted in Bill Clinton's time.&nbsp; The president
                  took the liberty of transforming the White House into a
                  brothel, lied shamelessly and cried right wing conspiracy
                  whenever anyone thought ill of anything.&nbsp; The air of
                  indignation on Democrats' faces when they defended the
                  scoundrel's honor was touching.&nbsp; In both cases, the most
                  cynical ban on perceiving the obvious is imposed in the name
                  of morality, instilling in public opinion the habit of
                  <a href="/semana/071029dc.html">revolutionary inversion </a
                  >.&nbsp; All of this seems quite extravagant, but it is a
                  masterpiece of high precision psychological engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The panorama of this election is dismal in all aspects.&nbsp;
                  Mitt Romney displayed the stature of a statesman precisely in
                  his withdrawal speech.&nbsp; He said the present election was
                  about major issues, not administrative routines.&nbsp; Never
                  has the USA had to decide on such grave matters with such
                  lightweight brains to bear the responsibility.&nbsp; The
                  disproportion between the problems and the cast of characters
                  is tragicomical, but the comedy will pass away and the tragedy
                  will become reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The blame for the present situation is shared equally between
                  the Democrats, who put their own political ambitions ahead of
                  the security of the USA, and George W. Bush, who refused to
                  notice this, preferring to embark the country on an illusory
                  national union against the foreign enemy.&nbsp; The union
                  didn't last three weeks.&nbsp; Any intelligent observer could
                  have seen this, but Bush staked everything on the patriotism
                  card without noticing that the patriotism of his adversaries
                  was completely fake.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the American tradition, public officials, particularly
                  higher ranking ones, have always been proud to serve the
                  State, regardless of which party was in power.&nbsp; Since the
                  Clinton era, the Democratic Party has broken with this
                  tradition, supporting, in the bureaucratic network, militants
                  who served the party, not the state, the people or the
                  nation.&nbsp; We also saw this happening in a certain
                  country.&nbsp; Isn't it the same thing?&nbsp; And we all know
                  how it ended.&nbsp; Since 9/11, George W. Bush's war plans
                  have been boycotted from within by the clintonistas in the
                  State Department and the CIA, who thus produced unsustainable
                  situations, the blame for which was shifted to the
                  president.&nbsp; The story is told in detail in the book by
                  Kenneth R. Timmerman, Shadow Warriors, the Untold Story of
                  Traitors, Saboteurs, and the Party of Surrender (Crown Forum,
                  New York, 2007), and anyone who does not know it will never
                  understand what is happening today in the USA.&nbsp; Refusing
                  to acknowledge evil is just as shameful as what caused
                  it.&nbsp; George W. Bush incurs the costs and responsibility
                  of having deserted the internal battle through the subterfuge
                  of an overseas war.&nbsp; Bush's timidity (or surrender)
                  destroyed it all. � Par d&eacute;licatesse j'ai perdu ma vie�
                  [through delicacy I lost my life], said Rimbaud.&nbsp; But
                  this prophecy, unfortunately, applies not only to the person
                  of the current American president. &nbsp;It is an entire
                  people who risk misfortune to avoid the indiscretion of naming
                  the names of their enemies.
