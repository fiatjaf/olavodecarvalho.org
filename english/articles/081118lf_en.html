                  &quot;What can we expect from an Obama government?&quot; is
                  the question of the hour. To answer it, academicians and
                  journalists invariably use a method that is renowned for its
                  inaccuracy: they examine the general tone of campaign speeches
                  and apply it to the objective problems &#8212; economic,
                  military, diplomatic &#8212; the new head of state will have
                  to face. This method fails for two reasons:
                </p>

                <p>
                  First: the method starts out with the assumption that the
                  institutional framework will remain unaltered and that
                  therefore the new president will carry out, in his own way,
                  substantively the same tasks as his predecessor. Consequently,
                  it does not envisage that in a revolutionary strategy, one of
                  the basic functions of the leader is precisely to redefine
                  these very tasks. Obama learned this lesson since his youth
                  from his guru Saul Alinsky: &quot;All change means
                  disorganization of the old and organization of the new&quot;
                  [1].
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second: it always assumes that the head of state represents
                  the national interest and will commit himself to safeguard it
                  in all earnestness, according to the balance he manages to
                  find between the demands of the militancy that elected him,
                  the claims of happenstance allies and the pressures of the
                  objective situation. This assumption, however, loses all
                  significance at a time that defines itself overall as that of
                  the emergence and implementation of world government.
                  Nowadays, the national interest of all countries is being
                  subordinated to worldwide plans imposed by an economic,
                  bureaucratic and intellectual elite whose power transcends
                  that of any particular nation, including the United States.
                  Many presidents and prime-ministers are installed with the
                  help or guidance of this elite, not to protect national
                  interests, but to oppose them based on much broader goals,
                  which, though described more than half a century ago by such
                  first-rate authors as Arnold Toynbee [2] and Carroll Quigley
                  [3], are scarcely taken into account by these academicians and
                  journalists, and for a very simple reason: as David
                  Rockefeller, one of the main leaders of globalism, publicly
                  acknowledged, the fight for the implementation of world
                  government would fail if prematurely disclosed. Therefore,
                  discretion, deceptiveness and disinformation are some of the
                  essential jobs of the mainstream media during the intermediate
                  period [4]. The &quot;anti-democratic means&quot; that Toynbee
                  found indispensable to the implementation of world government
                  include, quite obviously, control of the flow of information
                  sent to the general public. The increasing uniformity of the
                  world press &#8212; of which the campaign against the alleged
                  human agents of global warming, the universal anti-Bush outcry
                  or the waves of enthusiasm surging over Lula, Obama and the
                  World Social Forum are eloquent examples &#8212; can be easily
                  explained by the rising concentration of media ownership
                  precisely in the hands of the economic groups most interested
                  in world government. The fact that part of the lesser agents
                  in the process complain about this type of concentration,
                  arguing that it is the spontaneous effect of pure mechanics of
                  capitalism, is partly due to a residual ideological
                  automatism, and partly to the cunning desire of these groups
                  and individuals to conceal their own actions under the guise
                  of supposed tendencies or anonymous historical laws, putting
                  the blame for the most disagreeable changes on the previous
                  situation which the current changes purport to suppress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since, on the other hand, the media also has the role of
                  laying out &quot;common sense&quot; (in the sociological and
                  Gramscian sense), giving the people a sense of purpose and
                  reassurance as to what is happening, the cultured reader will
                  be forced, sooner or later, to choose between buying into the
                  mainstream opinion or trying to arrive at a more scientific
                  and realistic understanding of the state of affairs. In the
                  first case, he will be rewarded with that comforting sense of
                  confidence that comes with deceiving oneself together with the
                  majority of the people. In the second, he will attain
                  reasonable certainty enabling him to make correct predictions,
                  while seeming weird or irrational to most people. Because my
                  choice was made long ago, the method I apply to answer the
                  kind of questions posed at the outset of this article does not
                  rest on the usual academic and journalistic conventions, but
                  on elementary scientific precautions, which has allowed me to
                  achieve a certain degree of success in anticipating the course
                  of events, the price of which is, naturally, the hatred of
                  those who have failed to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of these precautions is as follows: at times of swift
                  change, imposed top-down by groups whose line of action
                  remains elusive, it is almost impossible to predict the
                  general course of action of a new government. All we can and
                  must do is abandon general predictions and confine ourselves
                  to those specific, scant but significant, points already
                  determined by the course of the previous action, so that the
                  new government must necessarily proceed with them. Instead of
                  deriving from the general picture the particular actions that
                  the head of state must hypothetically accomplish to deal with
                  it, it is convenient to start with the existing or practically
                  inevitable specific actions and, if possible, to ascend
                  laboriously to the general picture. I say &quot;if
                  possible&quot; precisely because in most cases we can only
                  achieve reasonable certainty regarding the specific lines of
                  action, whereas the general meaning of things remains as far
                  beyond our intellectual reach as it is from that of the head
                  of state himself. Even the most formidable powers are only
                  capable of determining a small fraction of the results of
                  their own actions. Hence any serious statement about the
                  direction of a new government must limit itself to the actions
                  it must bring to bear merely to keep and to expand the power
                  with which it has been invested, especially those actions that
                  fit immediate commitments that were previously agreed upon
                  with the political and economic forces that produced them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A second equally obvious rule goes along with the first:
                  whatever its proclaimed goals, any scheme of power will always
                  safeguard its own continuity and expansion first and foremost.
                  To act, St. Thomas Aquinas would say, you must first be. The
                  existence and continuity of the scheme are a prior condition
                  of its doing whatever it may want to do. Thus, what we must
                  consider before anything else is what the head of state will
                  necessarily have to do, not to reach this or that goal, nor to
                  face the objective problems that afflict the nation or part of
                  it, but simply to keep &#8212; and, in the case of a
                  revolutionary leader, to increase &#8212; the power of action
                  it already possesses. Consequently, I don't know what Obama
                  will do in general terms. Nor does anyone else. But I do know
                  what he's already doing and will have to keep doing, not to
                  achieve predetermined goals, but just to hold and increase
                  control of the means.
                </p>
                <p>
                  May I mention, by the way, that it was based on the
                  above-describe method that I announced, shortly after Lula's
                  first election, that he would not take any effective measures
                  against drug dealing, for the very simple reason that he was
                  lifted to power &#8212; and could be dethroned &#8212; by the
                  international scheme of the Sao Paulo Forum, whose interests
                  are fundamentally akin to the FARC's, now and then the biggest
                  supplier of cocaine to the Brazilian market [5]. A head of
                  state can do many things, but, barring insanity, can never
                  destroy the means of doing things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All Obama's career and his ascent to power were entirely
                  subsidized by notoriously anti-American forces. To claim that
                  they are only anti-Bush and not anti-US proves to be a mere
                  rhetorical twist, unworthy of attention. The essential role
                  the new president will play once in office does not differ
                  much from that which Strobe Talbott recommended to Bill
                  Clinton: &quot;Sell multilateralism &#8230;as a means of
                  preserving and enhancing American political leadership in the
                  world&quot; [6]. It purports, in short, to weaken and submit
                  to supranational institutions the national power it pretends
                  to enhance. In his campaign speeches, as well as in his aide's
                  declarations, Obama promised to reduce the US military budget
                  by up to 25%, to slow down nuclear research and - as amazing
                  as it seems - &quot;to demilitarize space&quot;. This would
                  allegedly make the United States more amicable in the eyes of
                  mankind and would afford it enormous diplomatic leadership in
                  the world. Only giddy schoolgirls &#8212; who not
                  coincidentally made up the most critical segment of Obama's
                  electorate &#8212; could believe in such stuff. The efficacy
                  of diplomatic action is, by definition, proportionate to the
                  military power that backs it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In every political action - and this is the third
                  methodological precaution I recommend - one must distinguish
                  between the final announced goals and the substantiality of
                  the acts performed to achieve them. The latter are a reality,
                  the former a mere hypothesis, if not a smokescreen. Therefore,
                  the meaning of the action reveals itself to a greater extent
                  in the nature of the means employed than in the stated nominal
                  goals. To militarily weaken a nation is &#8230; to weaken it
                  militarily. The notion that this could strengthen it
                  diplomatically is a far-flung hypothesis which is much too
                  contrived and contrary to all historical experience. What is
                  more, the supposed connection between the declared goals and
                  the chosen means is based on an assumption that is uniformly
                  that of mainstream anti-American discourse: the United States
                  is hated because of its military force; if it agrees to become
                  less powerful, it will be eternally loved by mankind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It must be noted that, in this case, what the candidate
                  emphasized in his campaign speech was not the materiality of
                  the means, but the supposed beauty of the aims, under frantic
                  applauses of a crowd of students to whom even the total
                  destruction of the United States would not be an idea devoid
                  of sex appeal. This idea has the exact same power of
                  attraction to all those who have financed Obama's career since
                  his teen years: Arab millionaires, pro-terrorist agitators,
                  globalist corporations and, last but not least, George Soros.
                  If one thing is right it's that the purpose of militarily
                  weakening the United States, already tenaciously pursued by
                  the Clinton Administration, will be followed to the letter by
                  Barack Obama, for the simple reason that accomplishing it
                  constitutes one of the main reasons of his existence as a
                  politician. It's something that he cannot afford not to do,
                  just as, by analogy, Lula could not help sacrificing Brazil's
                  interests and sovereignty to the higher ends of the Sao Paulo
                  Forum and the globalist scheme that backs it up, as we saw in
                  the case of the Bolivian pressures against Petrobras, and even
                  clearly in the Raposa Serra do Sol issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is indeed curious &#8212; and depressing &#8212; to find
                  that, at a time when national sovereignties are overtly
                  opposed in the upper spheres of world politics, and their
                  limitation or progressive suppression is even proclaimed as a
                  basic condition for the survival of the human species,
                  analysts claiming to be scientific still hold as an at least
                  implicit premise of their predictions the assumption that
                  leaders always behave according to the national interest, as
                  if they were Renaissance princes committed to breaking down
                  the empire's integrity and to establish new sovereign unities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today a leader can stand against the most vital interests of
                  his nation and be granted, for this very reason, so much
                  support from international opinion that his own people,
                  judging by the most visible appearance rather than the
                  substantiality of the actions involved, end up viewing him as
                  a kind of national hero.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Talbott's formula was followed to the letter by Bill Clinton,
                  who was consequently one of the world media's most endorsed
                  American presidents. He reduced the American atomic weapons
                  arsenal knowing that China was enhancing hers; he encouraged
                  American investments in China, while hampering American
                  industry with taxes and restrictive legislation; he blocked
                  probes into Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos nuclear
                  laboratory and, in the last days of his government, when the
                  chief Chinese spy involved in the operation was already in
                  prison, pardoned him without any sound justification. Needless
                  to say he was acting all the time against American national
                  interest and conforming to the strictest
                  &quot;multilateralism&quot; by stimulating the transformation
                  of China into a military and economic power, one that intends
                  to become the dominant center in the coming decades. Needless
                  to say as well that the applause thus received from the
                  international media created a huge impression in raising
                  American prestige, making decline seem like an improvement in
                  the eyes of the American people. He was even more
                  enthusiastically cheered for his &quot;humanitarian&quot;
                  intervention in Kosovo, which, under the pretext of punishing
                  a genocide we now know did not exist at all, had the only
                  effective result of turning a Christian region into an Islamic
                  stronghold, and at the further price of the actual genocide
                  perpetrated by Muslim troops trained and subsidized by Bin
                  Laden himself [7]. Once again, the sympathy of the
                  international media was sold to the American people as proof
                  of the great success of the anti-American actions ordered by
                  the president.

                  When Obama promises to enhance the international
                  &quot;image&quot; of the United States, in exchange for the
                  decrease of its military power, he's again applying Talbott's
                  formula: to substitute an image for reality and then to sell
                  that image as reality itself. That he's going to do this is
                  something that cannot be seriously questioned, because this
                  proposal is the fundamental or even sole explanation for the
                  worldwide support he received, a support that only a perfect
                  idiot would see as stemming from the spontaneous preferences
                  of the people and not from a coordinated effort of the
                  globalist elite who dominates the media organizations all over
                  the planet. If he steps back from this commitment, his
                  political career won't last one more day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But Obama wasn't elected just to repeat what Clinton has
                  already done. In addition to shrinking American power in the
                  international arena, he'll push for an enormous increase in
                  the American State's power to control the lives of its
                  citizens and to shape public opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm not saying that he &quot;can&quot; do this or either that
                  he &quot;tends&quot; to do this. I'm saying that he will
                  necessarily do this, if he's not stopped, because it is
                  essential to boost the power of the forces who elected him and
                  also to block, as of now, a potential return of Republicans to
                  both houses of Congress by 2010. To hold and enhance its power
                  is the most basic condition of the very existence of political
                  forces, and these conditions become ever more vital and urgent
                  when a political force has the aim of bringing about profound
                  changes in society. Whatever the substance of these changes,
                  the first one is &#8212; and must be &#8212; the consolidation
                  of the power of action necessary to enforce them. It was for
                  disregarding this fact that George W. Bush completely failed.
                  Instead of consolidating Republican hegemony by debilitating
                  his opponent, he chose to improvise a suicidal alliance with
                  the latter, forging a semblance of national unity against the
                  external enemy. This unity, when it crashed and smashed into
                  pieces at a speed greater than anticipated (except as seen by
                  the geniuses at the Department of State), carried away the
                  prestige of the presidency and the Republican control over
                  both Houses of Congress [8]. The Democrats do not ordinarily
                  make this mistake. Even now before Obama is sworn in, they're
                  preparing the revival of the restrictive legislation,
                  ironically termed <em>Fairness Doctrine</em>, whose sole
                  object is to destroy the already poor balance of the American
                  media, by transferring to the Democrats half of the time that
                  republicans hold on the radio, without granting to the latter
                  even the smallest amount of the Democrats' hegemony in
                  newspapers and TV stations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some Republican commentators, and by no means the worst of
                  them, have been wrongly reasoning, in accordance with the
                  second of the above premises, that the rules of the game will
                  remain the same, and thus even believe that Obama's victory
                  was good for their party, because it will throw onto the new
                  president the responsibility of handling the economic crisis
                  and, since he will most likely fail, it will pave the way for
                  the triumphant comeback of the Republicans in the 2010
                  legislative elections. This is one of the methodological
                  mistakes I referred to above. In 2010, the rules of the game
                  will be so radically altered that Republicans in general, and
                  conservatives in particular, will hardly be capable of making
                  themselves heard by the public. The &quot;change&quot;
                  promised by Obama could begin even before his oath of office:
                  inspired by the victory at the presidential election,
                  democratic senators and representatives can't wait to rubber
                  stamp the return of the catastrophic and anti-democratic
                  Fairness Doctrine [9].
                </p>
                <p>
                  To this fundamental change, which will give the leftist
                  establishment almost total control of the mass media, Obama
                  intends to add a more complicated one, whose implementation
                  represents an explicit commitment he made with the
                  enrag&eacute;e faction of his militancy, whose support he'll
                  continue to seek unless he wishes to draw against him the most
                  bold and outspoken part of the American nation, and he won't
                  fail to do it, short of being insane. I'm referring to the
                  &quot;Civilian National Security Force&quot; [10]. Obama has
                  been working on this idea for many years, in the framework of
                  the &quot;Public Allies&quot; non-profit. The goal is,
                  plainly, to arm the radical militancy and transform it,
                  according to the words of the new president himself, into such
                  a powerful and well subsidized force as the Army, the Navy and
                  the Air Force. The resources that will be allocated to this
                  mission have already been calculated by obamist planners and
                  amount to $500 billion annually. Every enlisted volunteer will
                  be paid $1,800 per month, and will be granted scholarships and
                  places at the best universities as well as many other social
                  advantages that, together with the weapons and the military
                  training, will quickly turn those fanatical mobs into a
                  privileged class with a fearful power.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whom will that power turn against? Is the &quot;civilian
                  force&quot; meant to replace the military in repressing and
                  controlling terrorism? Impossible. The Bush Administration
                  already reduced to zero the number of terrorist attacks in US
                  territory. And it doesn't make sense to go below zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Is the new force meant to combat criminality, to restore
                  public safety and thus promote social peace, the so-long
                  awaited &quot;reconciliation&quot; among the races? Equally
                  impossible. If, on the one hand, eighty percent of the Public
                  Allies militants already comprise black young people, the same
                  proportion will likely prevail in the &quot;civil force,&quot;
                  for where else, if not among his own militancy, would the
                  obamism recruit the volunteers for this task? It's true, on
                  the other hand, that of all interracial crimes perpetrated in
                  the United States, 85% &#8212; almost the same proportion of
                  the Public Allies members &#8212; are committed by blacks
                  against whites [11], notwithstanding the politically correct
                  detail that official statistics refuse to treat Hispanics as a
                  separate group and include them among &quot;whites,&quot; thus
                  attributing to white people those crimes committed by illegal
                  Hispanic immigrants against blacks. An immense work of
                  repression of interracial crimes would throw even more blacks
                  into prisons they already overcrowd. This would be dreadful
                  political suicide, which would send Obama against the
                  community whose skin color is one of the strongest reasons for
                  his occupying the presidential seat. (By the way, it is worthy
                  remembering that the usual &quot;racism&quot; explanation for
                  the bigger proportion of black inmates is a complete fraud,
                  for the states where jailed blacks proportionally outnumber
                  jailed whites aren't in the South, but rather in the North,
                  and they're not governed by Republicans but, rather by
                  Democrats [12]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is equally impossible that the new security force would be
                  meant to control illegal immigration. Obama is already
                  formally committed to the total amnesty project and soon the
                  very concept of &quot;illegal immigrant&quot; will be
                  abolished. Leaving out those three ends, what task remains for
                  a portentous force the same size of the Army, the Navy and the
                  Air Force, apart from policing and intimidating religious and
                  political groups the Left views as &quot;suspect&quot;? This
                  goal has already represented the democratic agenda since
                  Madeline Albright, who saw a great threat to national security
                  in the groups made up of religious, conservative and &#8212;
                  like half of the American population &#8212; armed people.
                  Except that, to repress these groups, the Clinton
                  Administration relied solely on the FBI and the state police
                  forces, where many agents and chief officers would naturally
                  abhor a drastic and comprehensive action against innocent
                  people. The young obamist militancy comes pre-inoculated
                  against that kind of ethical misgivings thanks to massive
                  propaganda.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To weaken the American State abroad and to strengthen it
                  internally are the two pillars of Obama's politics. He cannot
                  relinquish either of them, not only because they complement
                  themselves, but because they are the chief justifications of
                  his existence as a politician. His entire career has been
                  supported and subsidized by forces that strongly desire both
                  things. When I single them out as fundamental goals to which
                  the Obama government will attach its best talents, I'm just
                  drawing attention to two already ongoing lines of action, that
                  are strongly rooted in the Democrats' agenda once they come to
                  power, and that have been previously coordinated through the
                  broadest effort of militancy formation ever seen in the United
                  States (for his internet campaigns alone Obama has in place a
                  network of nothing less than four million people, formally
                  committed to continue doing for his government what they did
                  for the candidate). Whatever the general outlook the Obama
                  government may eventually show to the world, these two lines
                  of action will be there and will deeply affect the whole
                  ensemble. That numerous Republicans, Democrats or independent
                  analysts foresee a &quot;moderate&quot; or
                  &quot;centrist&quot; government, is due to the fact that they
                  do not have the analytical tools to understand the situation.
                  &quot;Radical&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot;, are usually
                  terms that better fit the description of rhetorical styles
                  than substantive actions. The leftist &quot;radical&quot; Hugo
                  Chavez was unable to dismantle Venezuelan opposition, while
                  the &quot;moderate&quot; Lula disassembled one by one every
                  pocket of right-wing resistance in Brazil, to the point that
                  nowadays only leftwing opposition remains. Obama could well
                  keep a &quot;moderate&quot; profile at those more visible
                  areas, and, at the same time, discretely undertake these two
                  measures that, per se, can not only irreversibly modify the
                  American political system but also &quot;change the
                  world&quot; as we know it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is obvious that Obama can be prevented from carrying out
                  these plans, either by uncontrollable factors, or by the
                  organized action of his opponents. What is certain is that the
                  effort to accomplish them, whether in a spectacular or in a
                  more subtle way, will be one of the unchanging features of his
                  government, and any success he achieves, no matter how
                  incomplete or minimum, will leave a scar on the historical
                  face of the United States and on humankind.

                  Fairness Doctrine, but he knows he won&#8217;t need to get his
