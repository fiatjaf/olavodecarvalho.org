            <i>O Globo</i>, May 28th, 2005
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            20<sup>th</sup> century&#146;s first half witnessed the rise of
            planned economy; the second saw its fall, followed by the appearance
            of an even more ambitious domination plan: planned culture. Culture
            transcends and includes economy: it includes the entire range of
            human creations, language and imagination, values and feelings,
            intimate life and unconscious reflexes. The widening of the
            objectives shows that the activist <i>intelligentsia</i> learned
            from the eight decades experience an opposite lesson from that of
            classic liberal and libertarian economists: the latter believe that
            socialism&#146;s failure proved Giant Government&#146;s intrinsic
            madness; the former learned that Giant Government failed for not
            being gigantic enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            Socialism&#146;s final aim, as Hannah Arendt observed, is the
            modification of human nature. The Lenin, Stalin and Hitler
            generation imagined that socialist economy would create this new
            kind of men. The deeper socialist thinkers &#150; Gramsci, Lukacs
            and the Frankfurt School &#150; saw in this a dangerous economicist
            mistake. The soul of the &#147;new man&#148; would not be born from
            socialism, but should come before it and create it. This idea
            sounded heretical to Marxist orthodoxes of the time (although, on
            the other side of the socialist range, it was not totally alien to
            the Nazi-fascist theoreticians). It has spread only in the last
            decades, providing the basis for the formidable expansion of
            internationalist leftism, which survived even Soviet economy&#146;s
            fall, and has reached its peak precisely in the years following
            USSR&#146;s breakup. Today&#146;s international socialism looks less
            for socialist regimes creation and more for the installation of a
            global complex of mutations in civil society, in morals and in
            family relations. The change in the order of priorities caused a
            harmonic change in the strategy and choice of means. Formerly, the
            revolutionary movement&#146;s essential tool was an ideologically
            monolithic party. Today, it is a variety of leftist parties only
            apparently disconnected, it is the international NGOs&#146;
            networks, it is the &#147;social movements&#148;, it is the large
            international organizations. Their unity of action can only be
            grasped from outside by those who are aware of the cultural
            war&#146;s subtleties, infinitely more complex than the older open
            conflict between pro-capitalist and pro-communist parties.

            Once the strategic line of action is understood, it becomes easy to
            follow the players in the game, from the public debates&#146;
            apparent confusion to their common origin in strategic planning
            offices invariably linked to the UN and to a certain number of
            billionaire foundations with which they are associated, as well as
            to some national States which, discretely and not without
            ambiguities, give support for the process. Today there is not a
            single &#147;cause&#148;, a single revolutionary fight or
            &#147;social change&#148; slogan that has not originated in
            technical and consultive committees outside any popular and
            electoral control. These ideas are then spread throughout the many
            nations as if they were spontaneous products of the impersonal
            historical movement, if not of the divine providence itself.
            Feminist revolt, abortion rights, racial quotas, the gay movement,
            agrarian revolution, indigenism, environmentalism, antismoking
            campaigns, legalization of heavy drugs &#150; all the fight flags
            waved in the world can be traced back from the public scene to their
            discrete origins on the circles of enlightened internationalism. And
            to spread them there are not only the &#147;networks&#148;,
            extending up to the infinite, but a whole millionaire bureaucratic
            system: the UN has even college courses to form technicians in
            &#147;creation of social movements&#148; in the Third World. All of
            them spontaneous movements, of course, and by spontaneous miracle
            harmonized in the conception of a whole new civilizational order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bibliography about this holds documentation that exceeds
            reasonable doubt by far, but, protected by the masses&#146; natural
            intellectual laziness, it will take some centuries to become object
            of common knowledge. And by then humanity will have no interest in
            knowing its origin: for it will have become the &#147;new
            humanity&#148;, drunken by the illusion of having created itself by
            way of the spontaneous forces of Progress and the Lights.
