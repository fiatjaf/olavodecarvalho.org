          <p>
            On January 14th, Mel Gibson went to Bill O&#146;Reilly&#146;s
            program on Fox News to denounce the persecution he had been
            suffering since he had announced his intentions of filming the
            crucifixion of Our Lord Jesus Christ precisely as it is narrated in
            the Gospels. An openly Christian film was more than the Politbureau
            of Hollywood could stand: reporters and private detectives did not
            stop rummaging through his bank accounts and private life in search
            of raw material for some scandal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having found no skeleton in the closet of the star of
            &#147;Braveheart&#148;, the facts twisters went on to plan B: they
            whispered in the ears of a conservative rabbi, Marvin Hier, said to
            be a frequenter of the White House, that the new movie, &#147;The
            Passion&#148;, was somewhat anti-semitic. Loads of reporters and
            critics, among them the Jewish journalist Jeff Israely from Time,
            had read the script without noticing anything of the kind. All the
            rabbi knew was that an article in New York Times Magazine had
            described, correctly by the way, that Gibson is an ultraconservative
            Irish Catholic. But, even with so little ammo, Hier did not want to
            lose the opportunity to do some work for the Simon Wiesenthal
            Center, of which he is one of the founders. Quicker than lightning,
            he gave an interview to the agency Reuters in which, in spite of
            confessing not having seen the film and not even having read the
            article, he threw over Mel Gibson the most disturbing suspicions,
            from making anti-semitic propaganda to wanting to use the film to...
            revoke the decisions of the Concilium Vatican II!
          </p>
          <p>
            The American media, despite its chronic leftism and sharp
            anti-Israelism, even covered the topic decently. But the Brazilian
            counterpart, which had not published one word of Gibson&#146;s
            denunciation, promptly gave wide cover to Hier&#146;s idiocies,
            implicitly presenting him as the unanimous expression of
            American-Jewish opinion. To make things worse, the incident became
            reinforced by an alarming prevision of an imminent &#147;witch
            hunt&#148; against the Hollywood stars that had taken part in the
            pro-Iraq marches. A real case of political persecution was thus
            covered under the dense layer of future speculation, while at the
            same time the victim was made out to be a bandit by the works of a
            witness that confessed to not know of anything against him.

            The reader may be asking: why give so much importance to this
            despicable cheating of Third World and third league journalists,
            just one more incident among thousands? Has it not yet been proved
            that such creatures are just useful idiots, or at least aspire to be
            so when they grow up?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is because the usefulness of their idiocy is, in this case,
            greater than even their bearers imagine.
          </p>

            Hier does not speak for the Jewish community. The most eloquent
            defender of Gibson in this case has been a Jewish writer, James
            Hirsen, from the Magazine Newsmax. The movie&#146;s main actress, in
            the role of the Virgin Mary, is the Jewish Romanian Maia
            Morgenstern, who would deserve the Oscar for Lack of Attention if
            after all these months of work in &#147;The Passion&#148; she had
            not noticed in it the signs of anti-Semitism, if in fact they really
            existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the rabbi himself is not a unanimity. He has been receiving
            heavy criticism from the Jews for refusing to use his influence in
            high circles in favor of Jonathan Pollard. Pollard is an American
            Jew, a Navy intelligence analyst, who once illegally passed to the
            Mossad data the American secret service had about chemical and
            bacteriological weapons made by Arab countries to be used against
            Israel. Being in trouble with the law, he ended up as a refugee in
            Tel-Aviv. Tons of petitions to three presidents still could not
            bring him back home. It is difficult to say if Pollard is a traitor
            or a hero. What is certain is that he is a hot potato in US-Israel
            relations and Hier is the last person who would want to hold it: he
            fears to be seen as annoying by the republican big fish, and his
            inaction would make him hateful to the thousands of fans of the
            exiled spy. Well, it so happens that the main political and cultural
            support for George W. Bush is the alliance between Jewish
            conservatives and Christians, already as old as many decades and
            stronger every day. Hier is the weakest link in this alliance
            because of his attitude towards the Pollard case. He becomes even
            more vulnerable since besides being a rabbi, he is also a man of
            <i>show business</i>: producer and script writer. He lives in an
            environment infested by fans of Saddam Hussein, the typical Martin
            Sheens and Sean Penns of the field. Imagine then why he was chosen
            to fry Mel Gibson&#146;s reputation until it could be made a potato
            as hot as Jonathan Pollard. How wonderful, for the enemies of the US
            and of Israel, to be able to use a right-winged rabbi as a tool to
            spread separatism between Jews and Christians, threatening to weaken
            the conservative alliance at the very moment that the worldwide left
            is in an urgent need to sweep the topic &#147;chemical and
            bacteriogical weapons&#148; under the carpet. It is even cuter that
            it is made under the excuse of fighting anti-Semitism, while at the
            same time they have released the greatest wave of anti-Semitism ever
            seen in the world since the &#146;30s. And it is almost sublime that
            they show such devotion in protecting the Jewish community from the
            fearsome Mel Gibson, while at the same time, in the streets, they
            march against Sharon and Bush side to sidewitho the nazi leader
            David Duke.
          </p>
          <p>
            And Mel Gibson? Gibson has merely played the biblical role of
            scapegoat in all this mess, with the difference that in the Bible
            the goat&#146;s sacrifice was used to reconcile the community, while
            Gibson&#146;s was planned to divide it.
          </p>

            Now, about the Brazilian journalists, with their traditional canine
            subservience to the ruling of the posh leftist fashion from
            Hollywood and New York, we cannot even say that they played the role
            of Judas. They are, at best, aspirers to Judas. For Judas, at least,
            knew to whom he was doing the dirty job.
