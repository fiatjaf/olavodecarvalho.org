          <div> 
            <p>The most obvious thing about the analysis of history and society 
              is that when a situation changes considerably, you can no longer 
              describe it with the same concepts as before: in order to account 
              for unheard-of facts, not classifiable under known categories, you 
              have to create new concepts or perfect the old ones through criticism.
            <p>With the stage of world government implementation already in full 
              swing, it is pathetic to notice that political analysts, whether 
              in academia or in the media, continue to offer the public analyses 
              based on the old concepts of &#8220;national state,&#8221; &#8220;national 
              power,&#8221; &#8220;international relations,&#8221; &#8220;free 
              trade,&#8221; &#8220;democracy,&#8221; &#8220;imperialism,&#8221; 
              &#8220;class struggle,&#8221; &#8220;ethnic conflicts,&#8221; etc., 
              when it is clear that none of those bear much relation to the facts 
              of today&#8217;s world.</p>
            <p>The most basic events of the last fifty years are: first, the rise 
              of the globalist &eacute;lites, detached from any identifiable national 
              interest and engrossed in the building not only of a world state, 
              but a unified and entirely artificial planetary pseudo-civilization, 
              conceived not as an expression of society, but as an instrument 
              for the control of society by the state; second, the fabulous advancements 
              of the human sciences, which have placed in the hands of those &eacute;lites 
              means of social domination never dreamed of by tyrants of other 
              times. </p>
            <p>As early as several decades ago, Ludwig Von Bertalanffy (1901-1972), 
              the creator of general systems theory, aware that his contribution 
              to science was being used for undue purposes, warned, &#8220;It 
              is perhaps the greatest danger of the systems of modern totalitarianism 
              that they are so alarmingly up-to-date not only in physical and 
              biological, but also in psychological technology. The methods of 
              mass suggestion, of the release of the instincts of the human beast, 
              of conditioning and thought control are developed to highest efficacy; 
              just because modern totalitarianism is so terrifically scientific, 
              it makes the absolutism of former periods appear a dilettantish 
              and comparatively harmless makeshift.&#8221;</p>
            <p>In his 1998 book, <em>L&#8217;Empire &Eacute;cologique: La Subversion 
              de l&#8217;&Eacute;cologie par le Mondialisme</em> (The ecological 
              empire: the subversion of ecology by globalism), Pascal Bernardin 
              explained in detail how the general systems theory has been used 
              as a basis for the construction of a world totalitarian system, 
              which in the last ten years has definitively gone from blueprint 
              to patent reality&#8212;a reality which is clear to all but those 
              who do not want to see. Von Bertalanffy, however, was not referring 
              only to his own theory. He speaks of &#8220;methods&#8221; in the 
              plural, and ordinary citizens of democracies cannot have any idea 
              of the plethora of scientific resources now at the disposal of the 
              new lords of the world. If von Bertalanffy had to mention names, 
              he would not have omitted Kurt Levin, perhaps the greatest social 
              psychologist of all times, whose Tavistock Institute, in London, 
              was founded by the global &eacute;lite itself in 1947 for the sole 
              purpose of creating means of social control capable of reconciling 
              the permanence of formal legal democracy with the total domination 
              of the state over society.</p>
            <p>Just to give you an idea of how far all this goes, the educational 
              programs of almost all nations of the world&#8212;which have been 
              in force for at least twenty years now&#8212;are determined by homogeneous 
              rules directly imposed by the United Nations, and calculated not 
              to develop children&#8217;s intelligence or conscience, but to make 
              them docile, malleable, morally characterless creatures, ready to 
              adhere enthusiastically and without discussion to any word of command 
              which the global &eacute;lite may deem useful for its objectives. 
              The means used to achieve this are &#8220;non-aversive&#8221; control 
              techniques conceived to make their victim not only feel as if he 
              is acting of his own free will when he yields to impositions from 
              authority, but also to develop an immediate reaction of irrational 
              defense to the mere suggestion that he should critically examine 
              the subject in question.</p>
            <p>It would be a euphemism to say that mass application of such techniques 
              &#8220;bears influence on&#8221; public education programs: these 
              techniques are the <em>whole</em> content of current schooling. 
              All disciplines, mathematics and science included, have been reshaped 
              to serve psychological manipulation purposes. Pascal Bernardin himself 
              meticulously described this phenomenon in his 1995 book <em>Machiavel 
              P&eacute;dagogue</em> (Machiavelli the Educator). Read it and you 
              will find out why your child cannot solve a quadratic equation or 
              finish a sentence without lapsing into at least three solecisms, 
              even though he comes back from school bossing you around like a 
              people&#8217;s commissar, demanding &#8220;politically correct&#8221; 
              behavior of his parents. </p>
            <p>The quickness with which sudden mutations of mentality&#8212;many 
              of which are arbitrary, grotesque, and even absurd&#8212;are universally 
              imposed without meeting the least resistance (as though they had 
              emanated from an irrefutable logic and not from despicable Machiavellianism) 
              could be explained by the simple school brainwashing that prepares 
              children to accept new fashions as divine commands.</p>
            <p>But obviously, school is not the only agency engrossed in producing 
              such results. Big media, now massively concentrated in the hands 
              of globalist mega-corporations, play a fundamental role in dumbing 
              down the masses. In order to achieve this, one of the most widely 
              employed techniques nowadays is <em>cognitive dissonance</em>, a 
              discovery made by psychologist Leon Festinger (1919-1989). This 
              is how it works. If you read today&#8217;s newspapers, you will 
              see that Tiger Woods, the golf champion, one of our most beloved 
              citizens of late, is now under heavy attack by newspapers and TV 
              news shows because the poor man has been found to have mistresses. 
              Scandal! Horror! General indignation threatens to drop half of the 
              adulterer&#8217;s sponsorship deals and strike him off of the list 
              of the &#8220;beautiful people&#8221; who appear on advertisements 
              for sneakers, bubble gums, and miracle diets. But there is a telltale 
              detail: beside the protests against the sportsman&#8217;s immorality, 
              there are fierce attacks on &#8220;right-wing extremists&#8221; 
              who do not accept abortion, gay marriage, or the inducing of children 
              to premature sexual delight. The two moral codes, mutually contradictory, 
              are simultaneously offered as equally obliging and sacrosanct. Excited 
              and impelled to all kinds of sexual debaucheries, while at the same 
              time threatened with character assassination in case he may practice 
              them even to a modest degree, the anguished citizen reacts through 
              a kind of intellectual breakdown, becoming a servile fool who no 
              longer knows how to orient himself and who begs for a voice of command. 
              The command can be empty and meaningless, as for example &#8220;Change!,&#8221; 
              but when it is uttered, it always sounds like a relief. </p>
            <p>Blaming scientists for this state of affairs is as idiotic as pinning 
              the blame for murders on weapons. Men like von Bertalanffy, Levin, 
              and Festinger created instruments that can serve both the building 
              up of tyranny and the reconquest of freedom. It is we who have the 
              obligation of taking those weapons out of the hands of their monopolistic 
              owners and learning to use them for the opposite purpose, freeing 
              our spirit instead of allowing it to be enslaved.</p>
