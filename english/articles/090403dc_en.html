                  There are some elementary historical data about the communist
                  movement which are ignored by most people and less known or
                  well forgotten by the leading cultivated minorities, but
                  without which it is literally impossible to understand
                  anything whatsoever about recent world history. If you try to
                  inform yourself and to take these data into account,
                  you&#8217;ll realize how many obscure issues become
                  automatically transparent, with little interpretative
                  effort.<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. Communism has been, throughout human history, the only
                  &#8211; I repeat: the only &#8211; globally organized
                  political movement, with ramifications and agents in the most
                  remote places of the Earth, all disciplined and prepared to
                  immediately, coordinately and simultaneously spring into
                  action upon the first call issued from their command
                  centers.<br />
                  <br />
                  2. Although it has at its disposal a huge number of
                  organizations and mass parties, Communism is substantially a
                  clandestine movement, whose command and action plans must
                  remain invisible to the masses, even in such periods of
                  lawfulness when many communist organizations can move publicly
                  without being persecuted. The primacy of the clandestine elite
                  over the visible leadership has been, at least since
                  Lenin&#8217;s time, a keystone clause of the communist
                  strategy. It is impossible to understand this strategy and the
                  tactics that implement it by taking into account only the
                  undisguised role of the most visible communist leaders in each
                  country, and without having access to the internal discussions
                  and the international connections of each organization.<br />
                  <br />
                  3. Communism has been, throughout the world and throughout the
                  ages, the only political movement that has at its disposal
                  unlimited financial resources, far superior to the
                  West&#8217;s biggest known fortunes and to the combined
                  budgets of many governments. Its potentials of action must be
                  measured according to the level of its resources.<br />
                  <br />
                  4. Only a tiny part of the communist activity consists of
                  directly or indirectly recognizable doctrinarian propaganda.
                  The main and most significant part consists of infiltrating
                  and blending into all sorts of organizations &#8211; political
                  parties (liberals and conservatives alike), media, unions,
                  government and private enterprises, cultural, educational and
                  charitable institutions, the armed forces, Freemasonry and so
                  on &#8211; it is an endless list &#8211; in order to turn them
                  into useful tools for the communist strategy, through which it
                  is possible to control the entire society, making the Party an
                  &#8220;omniscient and invisible power&#8221; (the phrasing
                  comes from Antonio Gramsci, but the idea itself existed much
                  earlier). It is infantile to believe that, once implanted in
                  those entities, the Communists will then turn to
                  indoctrination or proselytism, as if they were protestant
                  shepherds preaching the Gospel among infidels. Co-opting all
                  forces that may serve the communist strategy is an extremely
                  subtle and complex mechanism, which requires massive doses of
                  camouflage and deceptiveness, with many contradictory moments
                  on its way.<br />
                  <br />
                  5. It is foolish to imagine communism as a
                  &#8220;doctrine&#8221; or an &#8220;ideal&#8221;, particularly
                  when it purports overtly preaching the abolition of private
                  property. The communist movement has never had nor needed any
                  doctrinal unity, and has proved one thousand times its
                  capacity to tactically adapt to the most disparate ideological
                  formulas, either sequentially or simultaneously, thus leaving
                  the uninformed observer (including politicians in general and
                  the near entirety of liberal and conservative intellectuals)
                  completely bewildered. The most aggressive atheistic
                  campaigns, for instance, coexist pacifically, in the midst of
                  the communist movement, with the practice of taking advantage
                  of the religious discourse to reach the heart of the masses.
                  Mutatis mutandis, exploring radical nationalistic feelings
                  goes side by side with the effort to dilute national
                  sovereignties into bigger, regional or world unities, so that,
                  behind the scenes, the communist movement benefits from the
                  patriotic resistance as well as from the ascendant global
                  power. The unity of the communist movement is strategic and
                  organizational, not ideological. Communism is not a set of
                  theses: it is a power scheme, the most flexible, vast,
                  integrated and efficient one that ever existed. Even Islamic
                  radicalism, which is so quickly expanding nowadays, would be
                  powerless without the support of the world network of
                  communist organizations.<br />
                  <br />
                  6. An even more egregious form of foolishness is to believe
                  that the logical-formal opposition between the abstract
                  concepts of capitalism and communism can be translated, in the
                  field, into a mortal conflict between capitalists and
                  communists. To the multiple local and temporal situations
                  corresponds a countless number of shades and transitions,
                  which leaves much room for the apparently strangest
                  arrangements and complicities (but only apparently so). No one
                  will understand anything whatsoever about the historical world
                  we live in without taking into consideration the enduring
                  collaboration between the communist movement and some of the
                  West&#8217;s greatest fortunes, Rothschild&#8217;s and
                  Rockefellers&#8217;s for instance. The classic books on this
                  matter are those from the English economist Anthony Sutton,
                  but already in 1956 the US House of Representative&#8217;s
                  Reece Committee gathered substantial proof that some
                  billionaire foundations were using their huge resources
                  &#8220;to destroy or discredit the same free market system
                  that gave rise to them.&#8221; Today these foundations rank
                  among the most solid pillars supporting the socialist
                  government of Barack Obama.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ignoring or misunderstanding these facts lies at the root of
                  liberals&#8217; and conservatives&#8217; incapacity to resist
                  the triumphant march of communists in Latin America. Many
                  still believe, for example, that democracy will win a big
                  victory by forcing the FARC to abandon the armed struggle and
                  to constitute a legal party. They can&#8217;t understand that
                  to create a recognized political force is the final purpose of
                  any armed struggle &#8211; in Colombia or anywhere else.
                  Guerrillas don&#8217;t win wars: all they want is a
                  politically advantageous defeat. That&#8217;s the reason why
                  they open fire on the government forces, in the jungle and in
                  the city, and, at the same time, place their agents in key
                  posts of the legal leftist parties, where they protest the
                  blood shed and appeal dramatically for a return to lawfulness.
                  They did it in Brazil, and they are doing it now in Colombia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While liberals and conservatives can&#8217;t attain a clear
                  vision of the whole and complex phenomenon of communism, while
                  they insist on fighting the most immediate and repugnant
                  aspects of this movement, if not only communist doctrines in
                  abstract, they are doomed to defeat even as they claim
                  victory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fact that no international anti-communist movement has
                  emerged makes it difficult for many people to put together
                  this whole picture, which communists themselves so easily get.
                  But the absence of social support cannot work as a pretext for
                  intellectual laziness. There will always be some individual
                  minds capable of thinking above group prospects, when they
                  exist, or without them, when they don&#8217;t exist. Nothing
                  justifies that these minds be kept aside from the public
                  discussions, while the ignorant hold the monopoly of the
                  microphones. In this as in all other human affairs, those who
                  have studied nothing are full of simplistic certainties and
                  proclaim them with a huge sense of superiority, totally
                  unaware of their ridiculous role. Those who have studied the
                  issues may look deranged or eccentric, but after all, why do
                  we study if not to learn something that most do not know?
