                  Since the President of the Republic is a government paid
                  official, it is an inalienable right of any taxpayer to
                  ascertain that the beneficiary of his taxes meets all
                  preconditions to fill the job, which, however, do not end in
                  the electoral victory, but also include constitutional
                  requirements defined two centuries before the elections. As
                  with any civil service entrance examination, the burden of
                  proof lies entirely with the applicant: he is the one who must
                  provide evidence of his qualifications, and it is not the
                  State&#8217;s or the taxpayer&#8217;s obligation to prove he
                  does not possess these qualifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If some judges have lately been ruling the other way around,
                  it is because the American citizens who are questioning
                  Obama&#8217;s election in the courts mistakenly put forth as
                  their main argument suspicions about the President
                  elect&#8217;s nationality. Nevertheless, even if Obama were
                  born in the Capitol on July 4th, his would be the obligation
                  to demonstrate it with valid documents. The very refusal to
                  abide by this rule would be enough to testify to the
                  candidate&#8217;s disdain for the Constitution, thus
                  automatically disqualifying him for the job of supreme
                  defender of the Constitution itself and of United States laws.
                  By putting the nationality issue and not the lack of documents
                  in center stage, the plaintiffs are taking upon themselves the
                  burden of proof, thereby weakening a claim that otherwise no
                  judge could possibly dismiss.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As reasonable as they may be in themselves, suspicions are
                  just that: suspicions. The refusal to show documents, by
                  contrast, is a fact, the most established fact in this whole
                  incident. Actually, it is more than a refusal: it is
                  premeditated engineering of concealment, which was done
                  simultaneously in the United States and in Kenya, in order to
                  block all access not only to the birth certificate, but to
                  almost all of the President elect&#8217;s documents, without
                  which nothing his propaganda may assert about him can be
                  trusted, except through an act of irrational faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The unusualness of the situation does not rest as much on the
                  potential presence of a foreigner in the presidency as on the
                  fact that this act of faith is being required as a manifest
                  and unequivocal duty of all American citizens, to the degree
                  that any intent to resist it through the judicial system is
                  officially condemned as &#8220;garbage&#8221; (<em>sic</em>)
                  by Obama&#8217;s team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under these circumstances, it is meaningless to ask whether
                  the new president &#8220;will&#8221; or &#8220;intends&#8221;
                  to set up a dictatorial government in the White House. Even
                  before he is sworn in, a vast dictatorial strategy is already
                  ongoing, which is deliberately designed to place him beyond
                  the reach of the Constitution and the law, with the active
                  complicity of the mainstream media and a goodly portion of the
                  GOP. What is still more critical is that as soon as the
                  Obamist squad assured itself that the armor they had installed
                  around him had been passively accepted by the majority of the
                  electorate, the ban on inquiry was immediately extended to
                  other areas. First, the Federal Reserve announced it would not
                  release the names of those who benefited from two trillion
                  dollars in the form of emergency loans, making it virtually
                  impossible to identify those responsible for the financial
                  crisis. Secondly, the Federal Election Commission has refused
                  to probe 63 million dollars of illegal overseas donations that
                  flowed into the Obama campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unreachable and untouchable, the man who cannot be
                  investigated has already been granted free access to the
                  highest classified state secrets and is preparing to reign
                  under the double protection of the armed militancy,
                  transfigured into a &#8220;civilian national security
                  force&#8221;, and the Fairness Doctrine, which will rub out
                  conservative talk radio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, applicants to the recently posted 70 thousand civil
                  service vacancies are having their personal lives scrutinized
                  (gun owners being among the first to be cast out) and any
                  expression of hostility against Obama in the internet is
                  investigated by the Secret Service in search of
                  &#8220;racist&#8221; traits.
