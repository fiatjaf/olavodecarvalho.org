            <p>Besides listening to the national anthem with his hands over his 
              genitals instead of over his heart, Barack Hussein Obama has adulterated 
              the presidential seal so as to make it into one of his campaign 
              logos, declared that the American flag is &#8220;a symbol of oppression,&#8221; 
              and, as a finishing stroke, removed the stars and stripes from the 
              tail of his campaign jet, replacing them with the &#8220;O&#8221; 
              that stands for . . . himself. 
            <p>More than plain and simple contempt, this attitude denotes a conscious 

              effort at destroying the national symbols. This effort, in its turn, 

              does not require symbolic interpretation: its meaning is self-evident. 

              It gives electoral expression to the cultural war that has been 

              waged against the United States, from within and from abroad, ever 

              since the sixties: the point is to erect, upon the rubble of patriotism 

              and sovereignty, a new system of loyalties, based on the alliance 

              between every anti-American, anti-Western, and anti-Christian hatred 

              and the billionaire interests engrossed in the implementation of 

              the world government. The clearest token of this alliance are the 

              candidate&#8217;s sources of funding: radical and pro-terrorist 

              groups, on the one side, and the globalist megafortunes plus the 

              mainstream media in full, on the other. Hence the vigor of his campaign, 

              which has four times as much money as his opponent&#8217;s and&#8212;without 

              any exaggeration&#8212;gets twenty or thirty times as much media 

              coverage.

            <p>With this backup, he presumes not only to defy every convention 

              but also to trample on the most elementary legal requirements: after 

              withholding for months his birth certificate, he at last produced 

              a manifestly spurious one (see <a href="http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Politics/12993.htm">http://web.israelinsider.com/Articles/Politics/12993.htm</a>). 

              The original document, which is still missing, is necessary to clear 

              up an essential question: Is Obama an American citizen, or is he 

              an alien and therefore ineligible? The concealment and the subsequent 

              fraud speak in favor of the latter hypothesis, but the steadfast 

              enthusiasm of Obamaniacs, contrasting with their absolute lack of 

              interest in clarifying this question, shows that they would rather 

              demolish the American electoral system at one blow than allow Republicans 

              to stay in power: the new system of loyalties is already in force, 

              placing over national integrity the partisan ambitions of the Left.

            <p>With the same self-confident insolence, Obama&#8217;s government 

              plans run flagrantly counter to the will of the majority, without 

              the candidate having to fear the loss of even a single vote. The 

              nation wants gas prices down; Obama promises to send them up, by 

              maintaining the ban on new oil drilling. America wants to see illegal 

              immigrants depart; Obama promises not only to grant them amnesty 

              but also to give them taxpayer-funded health care. The nation wants 

              fewer taxes; Obama promises to create a few more. If millions of 

              American citizens who think and want the opposite of what Obama 

              does have sworn to vote for Obama for president, it is not on account 

              of what he promises, but in spite of his promising them even hell 

              itself. The attraction of the hypnotic image is stronger than the 

              cost-benefit analysis.

            <p>Obama&#8217;s campaign is a work of precision psychological engineering, 

              planned not to win over voters through rational persuasion, but 

              to weaken, shock, and stupefy them to the point of making them accept 

              every loss, every humiliation, every defeat, just in order not to 

              contradict the assumed moral obligation to elect him, it being of 

              little importance whether he actually is an enemy in disguise. Here 

              is what Obama is demanding&#8212;and obtaining&#8212;from voters: 

              that they sacrifice everything to a fetish, that they do so to some 

              extent consciously, sharing therefore the blame for the operation 

              and becoming in advance unable to fight against it once it has been 

              accomplished.

            <p>We have already seen this operation be carried out in Brazil, on 

              the basis of the stereotypical image of the &#8220;worker president,&#8221; 

              against whose crimes and perfidies no one can raise an audible voice 

              anymore, for everyone, dragged by the psychological blackmail, became 

              an accomplice somehow in the rite of sacrifice before the altar 

              of the idol.
