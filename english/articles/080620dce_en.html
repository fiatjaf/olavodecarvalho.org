        <div> 

          <div> 

            <p>When George Bush said that Obama's nomination &quot;is a statement 

              about how far America has come&quot;, he gave one more proof that 

              he would rather destroy himself, his party and his country than 

              saying any unpleasant truth about political adversaries who slander 

              him endlessly.

            <p>Responding brutal attacks with subservient kindness is a straight 

              path to the garbage bin of History. The American president has already 

              gone too far in this direction with his trait of depreciating himself 

              and his real merits while exalting the non-existent merits of his 

              adversary.</p>

            <p>The statement is particularly masochist since in this same week 

              the Democrat candidate, when asked if he would indicate George W. 

              Bush as ambassador in Iraq, answered that he would choose someone 

              more competent. Who could be more competent to represent a country 

              in a foreign land than the one who freed it from tyranny? To reply 

              insolence with warmness is a sign of weakness and, as Donald Rumsfeld 

              said, weakness lures aggressors.</p>

            <p>The president's opinion is not only inconvenient. It is false. 

              To assess a choice for a candidate by skin color is, literally, 

              to judge facts for their epidermic appearance. As I explained here, 

              what differentiates Barack Obama, what makes him unique in America 

              and in the world, is not his color, but his level of gross mendacity, 

              vulgarity and childishness, as never seen before in a candidate 

              for the presidency of a great nation. Obama's candidacy is, in this 

              sense, an explicit sham, a cynical demonstration of strength of 

              a globalist elite, aimed at proving that the American voter is finally 

              prepared to accept any trash that is thrown on them, even to the 

              point of self-destruction. This is by no means going far. It is 

              the ultimate symptom of the alarming state of deterioration of American 

              democracy.</p>

            <p>Just this week, two more telling facts have emerged that suggest 

              the democrat candidate fakes his biography with that na&iuml;ve 

              mischieviousness of little slanderers. First, he has not yet handled 

              to the secretary of the Democrats his birth certificate. Why would 

              an arrogant who already styles himself elected put in risk his own 

              candidacy for a burocratic banal detail? It can only be because 

              the document holds information that is inconvenient for him who, 

              like a nipper caught in a naughty prank, only makes it more visible 

              by the awkwardness with which he tries to hide it.</p>

            <p>What information it could be, is something that can be found without 

              difficulty from the second fact. Obama is being disavowed now not 

              by his schoolmates like before, but by his own brother &#8211; who 

              says that in childhood he was Muslim and not Christian as he uses 

              to say.</p>

            <p>All politicians lie, but with some style, avoiding silly lies easy 

              to be caught. Obama has not this sophistication, either because 

              he is not able to grasp it or because he has friends in places high 

              enough to be the most careless of liars without having to worry 

              about consequences.</p>

            <p>At this point, it is an euphemism to warn that Obama, if elected, 

              can bring serious harm to American democracy; that such a disqualified 

              person being accepted as a candidate is in itself a monstrous and 

              irreversible harm not only to the leading nation in the world, but 

              to humanity itself. This candidacy is truly going far, but into 

              the final ruin of the West, announcing the &quot;one thousand years 

              of darkness&quot; Ronald Reagan used to alert us about.</p>
