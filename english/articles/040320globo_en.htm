          <p>
            For some time, I have been closely studying the question of
            anti-Semitism. Some Jewish organizations in Brazil have heard me
            talk about it and thus know that I am no freshman in this subject,
            much less a na&iuml;ve, thoughtless busy-body. Whoever dedicates a
            long time to study a specific problem ends up raising questions that
            would not occur to the newcomer and sometimes finds answers which
            might seem incomprehensible and shocking to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            In May 2002, when the leftist media clamored against the
            anti-Semitic threat personified by Jean-Marie Le Pen, I wrote:
            &#147;Why should the Jews trust those who warn them against an
            unarmed enemy and who at the same time help an armed enemy? Why
            would the world left be so anxious to protect the Jews against a
            future and hypothetical danger in France, while at the same time it
            strives to deliver them right into the claws of a real and immediate
            danger in their own land?&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            But Le Pen&#146;s anti-Semitism, though unarmed, was at least
            explicit and undeniable. Mel Gibson, on the other hand, proclaims
            that the Jews were not guiltier of the murder of Christ than he
            himself is. Nevertheless, according to the enlightened media, there
            are reasons to fear him as if he were the Inquisition revived.
          </p>
          <p>
            I shall leave it for later to analyze the film that raised such
            uproar. For the time being, I would like to draw your attention to
            the following aspect: have you noticed nothing strange with the
            sudden outbreak of philo-Judaism that overtook the world leftist
            <i>intelligentsia</i>? The same people who supported a sham as the
            &#147;massacre of Jenin&#148;, the same people who compared Ariel
            Sharon to Adolf Hitler, now appear with their hearts overflowing
            with fraternal zeal, selling to the Jewish people protection against
            the fearsome genocidal Mel Gibson. Will you really buy that? The
            Pope, who has always been your loyal friend, says there isn&#146;t
            any danger: &#147;The Passion of the Christ&#148; does not instill
            anti-Semitic feelings in anyone, what has also been demonstrated by
            recent surveys conducted by the Institute for Jewish Research. Yet,
            would you rather listen to those same people who at the UN
            conference in Durban plotted to condemn Zionism as a &#147;racist
            ideology&#148;? Abraham Foxman has already admited that the film in
            itself is not anti-semitic, and Zionist intellectuals such as David
            Horowitz assure us that Mel Gibson is innocent. Yet, would you still
            be willing to give more credit to those wonderful creatures who took
            to the streets of New York screaming against the war in Iraq, hand
            in hand with Louis Farrakhan and David Duke? Would you rather seek
            protection against a farfetched hypothesis while exposing yourselves
            to the visible danger of accepting the services of untrustworthy
            protectors, among which we find, in Brazil, some closely linked to
            the <i>Forum of S&atilde;o Paulo</i
            ><sup><a name="1" href="#nota1">1</a></sup> and, through it, to
            Islamic terrorism? Would you let yourselves be manipulated, as
            Spanish voters were? Deceived by your enemies, would you then turn
            against your friends? Something in my heart tells me that this will
            not happen, that such a fabricated tragedy will not reach its
            dreadful intended end.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the leftist media knows how to match the deliberate suppression
            of facts with factoids. The official statement of the Pope in favor
            of the film was either omitted or deliberately downplayed in almost
            all Brazilian newspapers. Pro-Gibson opinions by American-Jews were
            totally suppressed, creating a false sense of hostile unanimity. On
            the other had, a major newspaper saw it fit to publish a long
            interview with the leader of an ultramontane group from S&atilde;o
            Paulo, endorsing the hereditary guilt &#147;of the Jews&#148; for
            the murder of Christ. You might read that and consider it proof that
            &#147;the&#148; Conservative Catholics are indeed anti-Semitic. What
            nobody tells you is that the mentioned leader is an isolated
            character, equally detested by all the traditionalist organizations
            &#150; which the newspaper misleadingly said he represents &#150;
            such as the TFP (&#147;Tradition, Family and Property&#148;) and the
            S. Pius X Society.
          </p>
          <p>
            So my message to the Jews is simple: no evil will come to you from
            the Christians. Today, the enemies of Israel are the enemies of
            Christianity. If you really want to know where the danger comes
            from, you should read the book by Rabbi Marvin S. Antelman,
            <i>To Eliminate the Opiate</i> (Jerusalem, The Zionist Book Club, 2
            Vols.).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is no need to endorse his diagnosis in detail. But you will
            see that in a general way he is on the right track &#150; and that
            track lies many leagues away from Mel Gibson.

              <a name="nota1">The</a> <i>Forum of S&atilde;o Paulo</i> is a
              Communist organization, founded in the early 1990&#146;s,
              co-chaired by Fidel Castro and Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva,
              the current president of Brazil. Its main objective is to
              coordinate the leftist movement in the region in order to
              &#147;win in Latin America what was lost in Eastern Europe&#148;
              (Castro). It gathers several leftist parties from all over Latin
              America, including the Brazilian Worker&#146;s Party (PT) and
              guerrilla-terrorist groups, such as the &#147;FARC&#148; and
              Chilean &#147;MIR&#148;. <a href="#1">Back</a>
