                  If there is one obvious thing in the world, it is that
                  Christianity is, in its origin, not a doctrine, but a
                  narrative of miraculous facts. Jesus Himself makes this very
                  clear in Matthew 11:1&#8211;6, when asked who He is: &#8220;Go
                  and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see: The
                  blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are
                  cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up. . .
                  .&#8221; If this is the self-definition of Jesus, this is the
                  definition of Christianity: not doctrinal discourse, but a
                  succession of miracles.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But we live in so stupid an age that people, even believers,
                  can no longer conceive what a miracle is: they believe it to
                  be a strange event to which a &#8220;divine cause&#8221; is
                  attributed for lack of a &#8220;scientific explanation.&#8221;
                  This idea is absurd. See, for instance, the miracle of Fatima:
                  it gathers together, at a single moment in time, a variety of
                  correlative events&#8212;the apparitions, the thousands of
                  cures of diseases, the prophecies confirmed by the course of
                  history, and, lastly, the dance of the sun, seen from hundreds
                  of miles away by people who had not the least idea of the
                  other facts which were taking place simultaneously. A
                  &#8220;materialist explanation&#8221; would require a
                  non-existing, rigorously impossible superscience, capable of
                  finding a common material cause not only for those various
                  facts of astronomical, medical, and historical orders which
                  constitute the episode, but also for their convergence at that
                  time and place as well as for their accidental coincidence
                  with Christian symbolics and doctrine.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In truth, such is every miracle: it is not a fact that can be
                  cut out in accordance with the standards of such and such an
                  existing or non-existing science, but an inseparable,
                  inexplicably harmonious complex of different facts pertaining
                  to different planes of reality. There can be no
                  &#8220;scientific explanation&#8221; of miracles prior to
                  their scientific description, and the latter cannot be valid
                  if it begins by severing the very data which it intends to
                  explain. Nevertheless, the mere hypothesis of a future
                  &#8220;material explanation,&#8221; though problematic and
                  virtually impossible, is often used as a definitive argument
                  to deny at once the miraculous character of well-attested
                  facts. Suppose that it is possible to find a medical
                  explanation for the girl who, cured by Padre Pio da
                  Pietrelcina, sees with no pupils. It would still be necessary
                  to explain the coincidence that this unusual medical fact was
                  one in the sequence of hundreds of other miraculous
                  facts&#8212;some similar, some dissimilar&#8212;which occurred
                  in the course of one and the same saintly life. For example,
                  the fact that the same priest knew so well the secret life of
                  so many people whom he was seeing for the first time, or, on
                  the contrary, the fact that he appeared in distant places to
                  people who had never heard of him and who afterwards, when
                  they met him, confirmed what he had told them in those
                  apparitions. The veritable, actually existing Padre Pio is the
                  same concrete human being who did all those things, and did
                  them not at isolated, unconnected moments, but in the course
                  of a life consistently dedicated to Him who, in Padre
                  Pio&#8217;s understanding, was the Author of those miracles.
                  What is the common nexus between those various
                  facts&#8212;between Padre Pio&#8217;s Christian discipline,
                  the girl who sees with no pupils, the apparitions from afar,
                  the intimate secrets known at first sight, and so on and so
                  forth? Either you find this nexus, or the &#8220;scientific
                  hypothesis&#8221; which you have made up to explain one or
                  other isolated detail&#8212;existing as such only in your
                  abstract imagination&#8212;is of no avail at all. The
                  impotence of materialist science in the face of miracles is
                  not some temporary obstacle that can be removed by future
                  &#8220;advances&#8221;: it is an insurmountable abyss.
                  Miracles, to begin with the one which we celebrate today, are
                  not ordinary facts temporarily unexplained: they are facts of
                  a specific order, with a recognizable and irreducible internal
                  structure, distinct from the facts accessible not only to this
                  or that materialist science, but even to a utopian
                  articulation of all materialist sciences, existing or to
                  exist.
