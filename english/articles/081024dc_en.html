                  Called &#8220;the Messiah&#8221; by radical Muslim leader
                  Louis Farrakhan and &#8220;My Jesus&#8221; by the college
                  associate editor of a student newspaper, Barack Hussein Obama
                  informs us, &#8220;Contrary to the rumors you have heard, I
                  was not born in a manger.&#8221; What if he did not let us
                  know?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Whatever the case, he has already performed at least one
                  confirmed miracle: he is the first presidential candidate who
                  has won the applause of all the enemies of the United States
                  without it having ever aroused the least suspicion of the
                  American establishment against him. Counted among his
                  enthusiasts are Hamas, Iranian president Ahmadinejad, Muammar
                  Khadafi, Fidel Castro, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, and the television
                  station Al-Jazeera. I wonder what would have happened to
                  Franklin D. Roosevelt&#8217;s candidacy in 1932 if he had
                  received ostensible support from Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler,
                  and Benito Mussolini.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is true that Obama pledges to dismantle the space defense
                  system of the United States, to slow down unilaterally the
                  American program of nuclear research, to turn victory in Iraq
                  into defeat, to ban new oil drilling, and to grant
                  driver&#8217;s license and health care to illegal aliens, that
                  patriotic mob which wants to turn Texas and California into
                  Mexican states. But if you insinuate that any of those things
                  is a good reason for Communists and radical Muslims to like
                  him, the media <em>en masse </em>will say that you have
                  &#8220;crossed the line&#8221; and that you are virtually
                  guilty of a &#8220;hate crime.&#8221; Ahmadinejad has declared
                  that the victory of the Democratic candidate in the election
                  will give the green light to the Islamization of the world,
                  Khadafi has proclaimed that Obama is a faithful Muslim
                  financed by Islamite millionaires, and Louis Farrakhan,
                  availing himself of the wave of pro-Obama enthusiasm, has
                  announced that the Nation of Islam, the secret society of
                  radical Muslims he presides over, which has been making slow
                  progress for decades, is having a &#8220;new beginning,&#8221;
                  and will be fully operational soon. The meaning of those facts
                  is clear, but noticing it is immoral: every decent citizen has
                  to swear that the support coming from the enemies of America
                  is only a mistake on their part, since Obama has never
                  given&#8212;oh, no!&#8212;the least pretext for them to
                  sympathize with him. To insinuate any convergence of interests
                  is to impute to Obama &#8220;guilt by
                  association&#8221;&#8212;an act of perfidy, obviously, loaded
                  with racial &#8220;overtones.&#8221;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Besides, any stronger word used against the black candidate is
                  pointed out as proof of racism, and the least suggestion that
                  there is racial blackmail in this is double proof. John McCain
                  himself makes a point of confining the debate to the sphere of
                  &#8220;ideas,&#8221; emphasizing that his opponent is &#8220;a
                  decent person and a person you do not have to be scared
                  of.&#8221;<br />

                  This statement is unintentionally ironic. The thing that every
                  American fears most, nowadays, is being suspected of thinking
                  bad things about Barack Hussein Obama. Following the example
                  of their leader, Republican militants are doing their best to
                  show respect and veneration for the person of the adversary. A
                  staffer at the John McCain campaign office in Pompano Beach,
                  California, who posted behind his desk a sign associating
                  Obama with Marx and Hitler was immediately fired. An Ohio
                  citizen, who asked some tougher questions to the Democratic
                  candidate about his tax plan, paid dearly for his boldness. He
                  had his life rummaged through by reporters and was severely
                  criticized for the heinous crimes of working as a plumber
                  without a license and of not having paid a traffic fine he had
                  incurred in Arizona eight years ago. That gives an idea of the
                  exasperated zeal with which the mainstream media protects
                  Barack Obama&#8217;s image. Samuel Wurzelbacher, or Joe the
                  Plumber,&#8212;the nickname by which he has become known
                  nationwide&#8212;draws from his experience an unavoidable
                  conclusion, &#8220;When you can&#8217;t ask a question to your
                  leaders anymore, that gets scary.&#8221;
                </p>

                <p>
                  This fear is not just psychological. Several Republican
                  activists have already reportedly been beaten up by Obama
                  supporters, McCain campaign offices in various states have
                  been broken into and destroyed, and only police action managed
                  to prevent, just in time, hundreds of well-trained Obama
                  agitators, armed with Molotov cocktails, from setting fire to
                  the buses heading to the Republican Convention in St. Paul
                  (even so, the remainder managed to wreak quite some havoc).
                  When a candidate employs terrorist methods, and at the same
                  time the establishment decrees that calling him a terrorist is
                  insanity to the utmost, it is clear that this candidate has
                  unlimited rights. He is allowed to receive $63 million in
                  illegal contributions from abroad, and nothing bad will happen
                  to him. An NGO that patronizes him can flood thirteen states
                  with fraudulent voter registrations, and woe to them who
                  suggest that he bears some guilt in the case. In contrast,
                  McCain was charged with criminal verbal violence for the
                  simple fact of mentioning the widely attested link between
                  Obama and William Ayers. A pro-McCain-Palin march, in New
                  York, was received with every sort of insult and threat. As,
                  on the other hand, no violence could be observed against Obama
                  militants, it was necessary to invent a story that, in a Sarah
                  Palin rally, somebody shouted &#8220;Kill him&#8221; after
                  hearing Obama&#8217;s name mentioned. The police looked
                  carefully into the tapes of the rally and concluded that
                  nobody shouted any such thing at all.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another intimidating factor is economic superiority.
                  Obama&#8217;s campaign collected nothing less than $605
                  million in contributions. For every McCain ad, four Obama ads
                  come out. Even more overwhelming is the free advertisement
                  provided by the big media for the Democratic candidate.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To this day, the only newspaper of some importance that has
                  reported the lawsuit filed by Democratic attorney Philip Berg
                  against Obama was the
                  <em>Washington Times</em>&#8212;nominally
                  Republican&#8212;which, nonetheless, categorizes doubts about
                  Obama&#8217;s nationality as mere &#8220;internet
                  rumors&#8221; and, alluding to the lawsuit only in the last
                  lines, as if it were nothing but one more rumor, omit
                  informing that Obama, instead of presenting his birth
                  certificate as requested by the plaintiff, preferred making
                  use of a complex legal argumentation in order to dodge doing
                  so. The second lawsuit on the same issue, filed in the state
                  of Washington, is not even mentioned.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The major newspapers and television companies protect the
                  Democratic candidate not only against his adversaries but
                  against himself. Acts or statements that may show him in an
                  unfavorable light are carefully omitted. In all the American
                  mainstream media one will not find a single word about
                  Obama&#8217;s long career as an abortion militant, let alone
                  about the only important activity he undertook on the
                  international level: the campaign set up, with public money,
                  to bring into power in Kenya the anti-American and
                  pro-terrorist agitator Raila Odinga, guilty of ordering the
                  murder of more than a thousand of his political opponents and
                  of conspiring with Muslim leaders to impose the Islamic
                  religion on a Christian-majority nation. Not only did Obama
                  help Odinga with American tax-payers&#8217; money, and
                  introduce him to contacts in the Senate, but spoke in his
                  favor at rallies in Kenya. If there is something that shows
                  the true nature of the international commitments of the
                  Democratic candidate, it is this episode&#8212;but even
                  <em>Fox News</em> omits touching upon the subject.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here in the United States everybody says that Obama&#8217;s
                  victory is certain. It seems to me that, even if Obama loses
                  the election, he will be a winner. The party of his
                  adversaries was already on its knees at the moment that,
                  instead of an authentic conservative, it chose a typical
                  liberal Republican for a candidate, a sure promise, if he is
                  elected, of a weak administration subservient to critics,
                  exactly like George Bush&#8217;s. After this first fit of
                  frenzy, there followed a worse one: from the moment when
                  Republicans, instead of filing a thousand lawsuits like that
                  of Philip Berg, accepted as a legitimate and decent electoral
                  adversary a candidate with no ascertained nationality, with a
                  misty biography full of flagrant lies, aided and subsidized by
                  the most heinous enemies of the country, it became clear that
                  they had abdicated all sense of honor and consented to
                  legitimate a farce. If they lose the election, they will
                  deserve as many tears as those who preferred to allow Lula to
                  win the presidency of Brazil rather than tell what they knew
                  about the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As to Obama&#8217;s campaign, its profile is clear. The
                  amalgam of utopian promises, overwhelming advertisement,
                  psychotic beatification of the leader, racial appeal, media
                  control, and systematic intimidations of voters is identical
                  in the least details with Hitler&#8217;s electoral strategy in
                  1933, but in order to say this in public&#8212;or even to
                  become aware of it in a low voice&#8212;it takes more courage
                  than one can expect from the average voter nowadays. <br />
