            <p>There is no politician left in Brazil who is openly pro-American 
              or pro-Israel, even among the ones who are defenders of a free market 
              economy.</p>
            <p>The entire mainstream Brazilian media, without exception, is anti-American, 
              anti-Bush, and anti-Israel, including those publications which due 
              to their past keep a conservative fa&ccedil;ade, even though they 
              are by no means conservative today. Everybody in Brazilian media 
              commenting on September 11 was unanimous in attributing to the US 
              several different degrees of the responsibility for the evil that 
              was done to them.</p>
            <p>There is no politician left in Brazil who is openly pro-American 
              or pro-Israel, even among the ones who are defenders of a free market 
              economy. There are, at best, those who defend good relations with 
              the US exclusively in the economic arena, taking at the same time 
              an anti-American stance in all other relevant international issues.</p>
            <p>There are no more conservative politicians or parties in action 
              in Brazil today. The last ones were ostracized in the last couple 
              of years, either through suspicions of corruption that were never 
              entirely proven, or by the defeat on the elections after a rain 
              of accusations in the media. The bulk of the opposition to the Workers' 
              Party (PT), the greatest left-wing party in Brazil, is made exclusively 
              by internal dissensions of the Left.</p>
            <p>Brazilian public opinion is massively persuaded that the US is 
              in a full-fledged imperialistic campaign to subjugate Brazil economically, 
              destroy it culturally, and, finally, to occupy with troops at least 
              part of its territory. In the media, no writer except me dares to 
              openly defy this belief.</p>
            <p>No conservative American author has his books published in Brazil, 
              at least by the commercial publishing houses, nor are they studied 
              in the departments of Philosophy, Law, or Political Sciences of 
              any Brazilian university. A recent publication, the Critical Dictionary 
              of Right-Wing Thought, which became reference material for all the 
              students in the area due to the fact that it was written by 144 
              university teachers among the most representative of Brazilian academic 
              elite, contained several mentions of David Duke and none of Irving 
              Kristol, Russell Kirk, Thomas Sowell, and other authors recognized 
              in the US as spokesmen for conservatives, so that the general idea 
              left in the mind of the reader is that the North American conservative 
              thought consists, essentially, of Nazism.</p>
            <p>In the media, in academic discussions and in public debates, all 
              the initiatives viewed as bad for Brazil, coming from international 
              organizations or great banks, are immediately attributed to George 
              W. Bush. The figure of the North American president has been so 
              demonized that he was drawn literally with the face of the Devil, 
              with horns and forked tail, on the cover of one of the main weekly 
              Brazilian magazines&#8212;a gross graphic expedient which, not even 
              a decade ago, would be dared only by communist publications.</p>
            <p>The American ambassador in Brazil, Donna Hrinak, made open propaganda 
              of the leftist candidate (and current president) Luiz In&aacute;cio 
              Lula da Silva, praising him as the &quot;incarnation of the American 
              dream,&quot; and after that enforced further the anti-American feeling 
              on the population, declaring in an interview that &quot;the US does 
              not respect Brazil&quot;.</p>
            <p>In the Armed Forces, the belief is practically unanimous that, 
              with the end of the USSR, the East-West conflict axle was substituted 
              by the North-South axle, or &quot;rich nations against poor nations,&quot; 
              and, therefore, the real enemy of Brazil in an armed conflict is 
              the US. This idea is subscribed to even by the majority of the conservative 
              officers, some with great prestige in the Armed Forces. The military 
              in general believe that the North American proposition of setting 
              up an air force base in Alc&acirc;ntara, Par&aacute;, is a Machiavellian 
              plan of the government in Washington against Brazilian national 
              sovereignty, and almost all officers subscribe to the leftist propaganda 
              that the Colombia Plan is a vile premeditated plot to facilitate 
              the penetration of American troops in Brazilian territory with imperialistic 
              purposes.</p>
            <p>In the frontier bases, many officers and soldiers are already dedicated 
              to the study of the works of Ho Chi Minh and General Giap, aiming 
              to assimilate the Vietcong war techniques for future combat against 
              the North American invaders. The School for Higher War Studies (ESG, 
              Escola Superior de Guerra), the main teaching center for the formation 
              of the military, is literally hypnotized by the preaching of anti-American 
              agitators like the journalist M&aacute;rcio Moreira Alves and the 
              historian Manuel Cambeses J&uacute;nior.</p>
            <p>For the simple reason that it obeyed economic policies set by the 
              IMF, the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration became known in 
              the media as pro-American, even though in reality it had much more 
              affinity with the European Union and the current anti-American mentality 
              found in the UN. On the other hand, this government has been hostile 
              to the Armed Forces, reducing their budget and their functions, 
              excluding the military of the ministerial meetings, stimulating 
              true and false accusations against military personnel that collaborated 
              with the extinct authoritarian regime, rewarding with jobs and public 
              money the terrorists that killed Brazilian soldiers, and so forth.</p>
            <p>The result was that the hate towards the government grew among 
              the military, along with the anti-Americanism. The widely recognized 
              fact that the anti-military initiatives of the government were fomented 
              by leftists did not change a single bit the attitude of the military, 
              who, becoming aware of the support given to left-wing organizations 
              by great entrepreneurial holdings like Ford and Rockefeller, interpreted 
              the rising of the left as the effect of a sinister imperialistic 
              plan plotted by the American government to debilitate Brazilian 
              national sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Well, a global movement to debilitate and neutralize the national 
              sovereignties did exist, but it did not come from the American government, 
              but from the EU and the UN, the same organizations that, on the 
              other hand, did everything to politically isolate the US and Israel. 
              As it happens, the latent conflict between US power and the great 
              international organizations was never made public in Brazil, not 
              even after the Durban Conference which made it patently evident.</p>
            <p>Therefore, everything the international organizations did against 
              national sovereignty (including the US's own) was immediately attributed 
              to the American government, viewed as a kind of deity controlling 
              everything that happened in the universe. When I mentioned in the 
              Brazilian press that President Clinton served more the purposes 
              of these international organizations than the American State, I 
              was called 'a loony' and thoroughly ignored, even among the military, 
              who usually had respect for me.</p>
            <p>To stimulate even more the anti-American hostility of the Brazilian 
              military, the dismantling of our Armed Forces strictly followed 
              a plan in ten steps suggested by the political scientist Samuel 
              Huntington in a book circulated in Brazil with the sponsoring of 
              Culture Minister Francisco Weffort, a man from the PT (Partido dos 
              Trabalhadores&#8212;Workers' Party) in Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
              cabinet.</p>
            <p>It is not surprising that the North American president who supported 
              international policies that tended to stimulate these hostilities 
              was the same who in the home front protected Chinese espionage, 
              tied the CIA's and the FBI's hands against international terrorism, 
              and debilitated the American Armed Forces. All this man wanted was 
              to obtain for the US, even at the cost of the long-term destruction 
              of the country, certain economic advantages that allowed him to 
              pose in front of his voters as the savior of unemployed immigrants.</p>
            <p>So, at the same time that he gave his country an image of an imperialistic 
              power, arrogant and proud, he made it weak and helpless, in the 
              military as well as diplomatic arenas. This is the path to self-destruction, 
              and I do not believe that Clinton, elected with Chinese propaganda 
              money, did it out of mere incompetence or lack of consciousness.</p>
            <p>The hate towards the US in Brazil today is so deep and so disseminated 
              in all social levels that it can only be eradicated through a long 
              and laborious educational campaign. It is necessary to explain to 
              Brazilians that the international organizations are not the US government, 
              that the fight of globalist imperialism for the destruction of national 
              sovereignties is not an American enterprise, being rather anti-American, 
              and that the nationalistic fa&ccedil;ade of the leftist organizations 
              in Brazil hides their collaboration with the anti-American globalist 
              imperialism. If this is not made at once, any belligerent position 
              the next government adopts against the US will be applauded by all 
              the Brazilian people, fallen into the web of a tragic deceit.</p>
