            (Andr&eacute; Gide)
          </p>
          <p>
            Gide was right: for a writer, the interesting thing is to say
            exactly what everybody else has agreed not to say. But the
            interesting thing may be dangerous as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my last week&#146;s article, for example, I gave two hints as
            interesting as they are forbidden. First: Federal deputy Alberto
            Fraga (PMDB-DF) claims to have definitive proofs of financial
            support given to the PT in the last elections by the Colombian
            guerrilla force (now it already has 88 signatures in its
            requirements for the start of a CPI<sup
              ><a name="1" href="#nota1">1</a></sup
            >
            to examine the case). Second: that all neo-Nazi, neo-Fascist and
            anti-Semitic movements in the world are aligned with the Saddamist
            or anti-Bush cause, whose apostles, by calling by those names
            precisely those who are their adversaries, do nothing but imitate
            the example of Stalin, who camouflaged his alliance with Hitler
            behind a fa&ccedil;ade of anti-Nazism, as grandiloquent and
            histrionic as consciously pretended.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having given this news, the reaction came fast: my condemnation to
            death, which used to arrive discreetly by e-mail, came to be
            published, without the least inhibition, on Internet sites. They are
            open invitations to the leftist militants to finish me as soon as
            possible, preferably by cruel and painful means:
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;Yes, comrades, &#150; writes one of my virtual executioners in
            the site
            <a href="http://www.comunismo.com.br">www.comunismo.com.br</a>
            &#150; it is precisely this I am talking about:
            <i>lynching, judgment and summary execution</i>, with no right to a
            defense. This human scum is not part of the solution, it&#146;s part
            of the problem. And he who is part of the problem must be physically
            eliminated. A fascist has no right to a turn or a voice. To silence
            their voices, we must identify them, and if not killing them
            <i>tout court</i>, cut off their hands so they cannot express their
            ideas through writing, and cut out their tongues so they cannot
            express themselves verbally.&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            Giving more details, the site
            <a

            informs those interested of the place where I give classes regularly
            and, repeating hundreds of times the motto &#147;Death to Olavo de
            Carvalho&#148;, suggests:
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;Is it not time to bring a physical end to this cancer named
            Olavo de Carvalho? Why not call for a protest in front of the place
            where he teaches and, if possible, physically eliminate this
            fascist, racist, miserable scumbag?&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            How beautiful it is to hear these adjectives from the mouth of those
            who march side-to-side with skinheads for the destruction of the
            State of Israel! How touching it is reading the call for my gruesome
            elimination, and, some lines ahead, discover that it is, according
            to their advocates, part of a &#147;campaign against
            intolerance&#148; (<i>sic</i>).
          </p>
          <p>
            If, when I was a child, they had told me that I would live to
            witness something like this, I would not have believed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it must be progress. Tired of sending me threats that I answered
            with four-letter words, and of spreading fake messages in my name
            that any sensible reader could identify at first sight as childish
            fakes, the boys thought it was time for an upgrade, or as Mao Tse
            Tung used to say, for a qualitative leap in the proletariat
            struggle. They changed from whispers to shouting, from threats to
            the preparation for attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is even more wonderful to know that these nuts are doing nothing
            but putting into practice the teachings they received from
            intellectuals and educators who, far from the stage, elegant and
            neat in their departments and newspaper columns, incarnate the
            living personification of civilized relations and good feelings. The
            ineffable Dr. Ant&ocirc;nio C&acirc;ndido, for example (I quote him
            in particular for no special reason, as one among thousands), said
            that there was no evil in suspending for some time rights and
            guarantees, if it was to build socialism. Well, there you have it,
            Dr. Ant&ocirc;nio, you have not waited in vain: the boys from
            &#147;M&iacute;dia Independente&#148; have already suspended
            <i>my</i> rights and guarantees. It&#146;s not socialism yet, but
            it&#146;s already something. Now, of course, Dr. Ant&ocirc;nio or
            anyone else in his place will say they did not want to go that far.
            Leftist intellectuals never want to go where they arrive. They never
            wanted the Gulag, the Laogai, the extinction of Ukranians by hunger
            or one million murdered Tibetans. They never wanted anything of what
            they actually produced: it was all the fault of cursed coincidences.
            They, the owners of all good intentions, always get away clean, do
            whatever they may.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment, for example, they campaign against the American
            intervention in Iraq, but they say they are not pro Saddam Hussein.
            No, they are not. They are only against taking him out of power.
            They are against preventing him, by force or any other mean (for
            they also abhor the economic sanctions) from continuing to kill
            peaceful Iraqis, at the rate of 110 per day &#150; much more than
            the war &#150; as he has been doing in the last 24 years. They do
            not defend Saddam Hussein, but the Iraqi sovereignty &#150; that is
            the sovereignty of Saddam Hussein. Who can demand from these
            creatures the responsibility for the consequence of their words, if
            their words are the very inconsequence themselves? Who can demand
            responsibility from creatures who give themselves the right to dream
            a new world shaped to their image and likeness and never have to
            recognize as their own work the hideous figure of their realized
            dream?
          </p>
          <p>
            To whom then, should I run, looking for protection? To the
            authorities of a government to which, precisely, the Pure<sup
              ><a name="2" href="#nota2">2</a></sup
            >
            trusted the realization of their most beautiful hopes? To those who
            deputy Fraga accuses of receiving money from the largest homicidal
            organization in Latin America? <i>Loco s&iacute;, pero no tonto</i
            ><sup><a name="3" href="#nota3">3</a></sup
            >, I would rather admit that I already don&#146;t have any rights,
            any guarantees. What is the value of rights and guarantees put under
            the protection of people who are more willing to protect the Farc
            against the Colombian government than Brazilian citizens against the
            Farc?
