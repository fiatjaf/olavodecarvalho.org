                  The protest of the Russian government against the moral
                  equation of Nazism with Communism boils down to one of the
                  most fearful historical falsifications of all times. Fearful
                  because of the magnitude of the lie enveloped therein and
                  doubly fearful because of the easy credulity with which it is
                  generally welcomed by non-Communists and even anti-Communists.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Even John Earl Haynes, the great historian of American
                  anti-Communism, underwrites this error: &#8220;Unlike Nazism,
                  which explicitly placed war and violence at the core of its
                  ideology, Communism sprang from idealistic roots.&#8221;
                  Nothing in the historical documents justifies this statement.
                  Centuries before Nazism and Fascism emerged, Communism was
                  already spreading terror and slaughter throughout Europe and
                  reached an apex of violence in the France of 1793. The very
                  conception of genocide&#8212;the thorough extermination of
                  peoples, races, and nations&#8212;is Communist in origin, and
                  its clearest expression was already in the writings of Marx
                  and Engels half a century before the birth of Hitler and
                  Mussolini.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The romanticized idealism is on the periphery and not at the
                  core of the Communist doctrine: the leaders and mentors have
                  always laughed at it, leaving it to the crowd of &#8220;useful
                  idiots.&#8221; It is significant that Marx, Engels, Lenin,
                  Stalin, Mao, or Che Guevara dedicated very few lines to the
                  description of the future Communist society and its supposed
                  beauties, preferring to fill whole volumes with the emphatic
                  expression of their hatred not only of the bourgeois and the
                  aristocrats but of millennia of intellectual and moral
                  culture, pejoratively explained away as mere ideological
                  camouflage for financial interest and lust for power. Among
                  non-Communists, the usual ascription of idealistic motives to
                  Communism is born of no objective sign that they can identify
                  in the works of the Communist grandees, but simply of the
                  inverse projection of the rhetoric of accusation and
                  denunciation that bubbles in them as in a cauldron of hate.
                  The na&iuml;ve reader&#8217;s spontaneous reaction before
                  these works is to imagine that so much repulsion to evil can
                  only be born of a deep love of the good. But it is proper to
                  evil to hate itself, and it is simply not possible that the
                  reduction of all moral, religious, artistic, and intellectual
                  values of humanity to the condition of ideological camouflage
                  for lower impulses is inspired by the love of the good. The
                  gaze of fierce suspicion that Marx and his continuators direct
                  against the most elevated creations of the past centuries
                  denotes, rather, the satanic malice that attempts to see evil
                  in everything so as to look more bearable in the comparison.
                  To accept the legend of Communist idealism as true, we would
                  have to invert all standards of moral judgment, admitting that
                  the martyrs who let themselves be killed in the Roman arena
                  acted out of vile interest, whereas the murderers of
                  Christians in the Soviet Union and in China acted out of sheer
                  goodness.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the rare moments when one of the Communist theoreticians
                  allows himself to contemplate imaginatively the supposed
                  virtues of the future society, he does so in such exaggerated
                  and caricatural terms that they can only be explained as a fit
                  of hysterical self-excitement with no connection with the
                  substantive ground of his theories. No one can repress an
                  ironic smile when Trotsky says that in the Communist society
                  every street sweeper will be a new Leonardo da Vinci. This, as
                  a project of society, is a joke&#8212;Communism as a whole is
                  a joke. It is only serious as an enterprise of hate and
                  destruction.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Moreover, the Russian protest purposely suppresses two
                  fundamental historical data:
                </p>

                <p>
                  1. Fascism was born of a mere internal split of the Socialist
                  movement and not as an external reaction. Its origin, as has
                  been conclusively proved, lies in the disappointment of
                  European Socialists with the adherence of the proletariat of
                  the several nations to the patriotic appeal of the war
                  propaganda in 1914. Grounded on the idea that economic class
                  solidarity was a deeper and more solid bond than national
                  identities&#8212;allegedly factitious inventions of the
                  bourgeoisie to camouflage its economic interests&#8212;Lenin
                  and his party fellows believed that in the event of a European
                  war the proletarians called to the trenches would rise
                  <em>en masse </em>against their respective governments and
                  would turn the war into a general Socialist uprising. This is
                  exactly the opposite of what happened. Everywhere the
                  proletariat adhered enthusiastically to the appeal of
                  bellicose nationalism, against which not even some of the most
                  outstanding Socialist leaders in France and in Germany were
                  immune. At the end of the war, it was only natural that the
                  Leninist myth of class solidarity should be subjected to
                  dissolving critical analyses and that the concept of
                  &#8220;nation&#8221; should be revalued as a unifying symbol
                  of the Socialist struggle. Hence the great divide of the
                  revolutionary movement: the one part remained faithful to the
                  internationalist banner, thus being compelled to perform
                  complicate mental gymnastics to reconcile it with the Soviet
                  nationalism, while the other part simply preferred to create a
                  new formula of revolutionary struggle&#8212;the nationalist
                  Socialism, or National Socialism. It is not devoid of meaning
                  that at the origin of &#8220;German Socialism&#8221;&#8212;as
                  it was universally called in the thirties&#8212;the largest
                  dose of financial contributions to Hitler&#8217;s party came
                  precisely from the proletarian militancy (see James Pool,
                  <em
                    >Who Financed Hitler: The Secret Funding of Hitler&#8217;s
                    Rise to Power, 1919&#8211;1933</em
                  >, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1997). For a body that
                  Communists would later claim to be exclusively a class
                  instrument of the bourgeoisie, it would have been quite a
                  paradoxical beginning, if only this Soviet official
                  explanation were not, as indeed it was and is, just a
                  publicity ploy to camouflage
                  <em>ex post facto</em> Stalin&#8217;s accountability for the
                  strengthening of the Nazi regime.
                </p>

                <p>
                  2. Ever since the twenties the Soviet government, persuaded
                  that German nationalism was a useful tool for breaking the
                  bourgeois order in Europe, applied itself to promoting in
                  secrecy the creation of a German army in Russian territory,
                  thus violating the prohibition imposed by the Treaty of
                  Versailles. Without this collaboration, which intensified
                  after Hitler&#8217;s rise to power, it would have been
                  impossible for Germany to become a military power capable of
                  disturbing the world equilibrium. Part of the Communist
                  militancy felt deeply disappointed with Stalin on the occasion
                  of the signing of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact, which in 1939
                  made the Soviet Union and Germany partners in the brutal
                  imperialist attack against Poland. But the agreement came as
                  scandalous news only because no one outside the high Soviet
                  circles knew about that military support, which was already
                  more than a decade old and without which Nazism would never
                  have come to constitute a menace to the world. Denouncing
                  Nazism in words and promoting it through decisive actions was
                  the constant Soviet policy since the rise of Hitler&#8212;a
                  policy that was interrupted only when the German dictator,
                  contrary to all that Stalin could have expected, attacked the
                  Soviet Union in 1941. From both the ideological and the
                  military points of view, Fascism and Nazism are branches of
                  the Socialist movement. (There is no need to emphasize their
                  all too obvious common origin in evolutionism and in the
                  &#8220;cult of science.&#8221; Whoever wishes to learn more
                  about it will do well to read Richard Overy,
                  <em
                    >The Dictators: Hitler&#8217;s Germany and Stalin&#8217;s
                    Russia</em
                  >, New York: Norton, 2004.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  But there still remains one point to be considered. While
                  Communism proved uniformly cruel and genocidal in all
                  countries where it spread, the same cannot be said of Fascism.
                  Communist China soon surpassed the USSR itself in genocidal
                  fury against its own population, but no Fascist regime outside
                  Germany ever compared, not even remotely, with Nazi brutality.
                  Rather, in most nations where it prevailed, Fascism tended
                  toward a soft authoritarianism, which not only reserved the
                  use of violence for the most dangerous armed enemies, but even
                  tolerated the coexistence with hostile and rival powers. In
                  the very Italy of Mussolini, the Fascist government accepted
                  the rivalry of the monarchy and the Church&#8212;which in
                  Hannah Arendt&#8217;s most pertinent analysis already suffices
                  to exclude it from the category of
                  &#8220;totalitarianism.&#8221; In Latin America, no military
                  dictatorship&#8212;whether &#8220;Fascist&#8221; or
                  not&#8212;ever reached the record of a hundred thousand
                  victims that, according to the latest calculations, has
                  resulted from the Communist dictatorship in Cuba. Compared
                  with Fidel Castro, Pinochet is a harmless little dove. In
                  other areas of the Third World, no allegedly Fascist regime
                  ever did anything like the horrors of Communism in Vietnam and
                  in Cambodia. Nazism is a specifically German variant of
                  Fascism, and this variant is distinguished from the others by
                  the abnormal dose of violence and cruelty that it desired and
                  attained. In the matter of perilousness, Communism is to
                  Fascism as the Mafia is to some neighborhood rapist. But we
                  should not forget what Saint Thomas Aquinas says: the
                  difference between hate and fear is a question of
                  proportion&#8212;when the assailant is weaker, you hate him;
                  when he is stronger, you fear him. Fascism is easy to hate
                  simply because it was always weaker than Communism and above
                  all because, as an organized political force, it is dead and
                  buried. Fascism never had at its service a secret police the
                  size of the KGB, with its five hundred thousand officers,
                  unlimited secret budget, and at least five million informal
                  agents throughout the world. Even in terms of advertisement,
                  Goebbels&#8217;s lies were childish tricks as compared with
                  Willi M&uuml;nzenberg&#8217;s refined techniques and with the
                  powerful industry of <em>desinformatzia</em> still fully
                  operative in the world. While at the end of World War II the
                  general pressure of the victorious nations led two dozens of
                  defendants to the Nuremberg Court and initiated the implacable
                  persecution to Nazi war criminals&#8212;which lasts until
                  today&#8212;the end of the Soviet Union was followed by
                  general efforts to prevent any accusation, however small, from
                  being brought against Communist leaders responsible for five
                  times as great a genocide. In Cambodia, the single country
                  that has had the courage to essay a judicial investigation
                  against the former Communist rulers, the UN did everything to
                  thwart this initiative&#8212;which to this day is dragging
                  through a thousand bureaucratic obstacles&#8212;awaiting death
                  of old age to deliver the offenders from punishment. Fascism
                  attracts hate because it is a gruesome relic of the past.
                  Communism is alive, and its perilousness has not at all
                  diminished. The fear that it inspires transmutes easily into
                  affectation of reverence, for the selfsame motives that led
                  Stalin&#8217;s entourage to feign love for him so as not to
                  confess the terror that he inspired.
