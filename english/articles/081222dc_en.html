                  &#8220;Monroe must be rolling in his grave,&#8221; remarked
                  Julia Sweig, director of the Latin-American program of the
                  Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), upon learning that the USA
                  was locked out of the Latin America State leaders&#8217;
                  summit in Costa do Sau&iacute;pe, Bahia, Brazil. The famous
                  1823 doctrine, which placed the continent out of the range of
                  European powers and made it a sphere of influence of the USA,
                  is dead and buried.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is the inevitable result of President George W.
                  Bush&#8217;s policy of trying to seduce the Latin American
                  &#8220;moderate left&#8221; and make it a containment wall
                  against the avalanche of revolutionary leftism. There was
                  virtually no one in high Washington DC circles, American big
                  media and the CFR itself who would not consider this policy
                  the pinnacle of universal diplomatic wisdom. The Democrats
                  only complained &#8211; a bit &#8211; that it was not leftist
                  enough. Republicans reacted with contempt and impatience at
                  any attempt to point out its fundamental flaw.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since I arrived to the USA in May 2005, I have made speeches
                  in several conservative institutions and handed out dozens of
                  articles to politicians and opinion makers, telling them that
                  ignoring the deep unity of the Latin American left, betting on
                  the possibility of pitting one country against the other by
                  means of trading advantages, was an enormous act of stupidity,
                  if not of deliberate treason that the leftists in the
                  Department of State were nourishing and that the right-wing
                  lackeys refused to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Celebrated by the left as a display of
                  &#8220;independence,&#8221; the distancing of the continent
                  from the USA is far from that: it is wholesale and overt
                  submission to the expansionist strategy of the Russians,
                  Chinese and Iranians. In recent years, the Chinese President
                  Hu Jintao spent more time in Latin America than George W.
                  Bush, increasing trading and diplomatic relations with several
                  countries on the continent. Mahmud Ahmadinejad already has an
                  invitation to visit Brazil and Russian warships are sailing
                  merrily about in joint maneuvers with Venezuelan warships in
                  an area where such would have been unthinkable some years ago.
                  It is impossible to gauge Russian and Chinese encroachment in
                  Brazilian business through an infinity of frontmen, but, as a
                  rule of thumb, where you read &#8220;Spain&#8221; construe
                  that as &#8220;Russia.&#8221; The reintegration of Cuba in the
                  Latin-American community, with no concessions whatsoever in
                  the human rights area in exchange, was celebrated by President
                  Lula as a chief motivation for the summit, even if nothing
                  else would be settled there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lula, of whom George W. Bush had high expectations as an
                  essential instrument of American diplomacy to stop the advance
                  of continental communism, is himself, just as much today as
                  since the foundation of the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum in 1990,
                  the great mastermind of Latin-American subversion, something
                  that this summit made clearer than ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If, at the same time, he nourishes market economy and
                  international free trade, he follows in this the same
                  guidelines of the Russians, the Chinese and of all the
                  international communist movement: to postpone sine die the
                  socialization of the production means and use capitalist
                  growth itself as a means to build global leftist political
                  power. What Lenin did in Russia is now being applied on a
                  worldwide scale: seduction of capitalists with smooth talk
                  while the political power of the communist movement is
                  increased to the utmost limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accustomed to making the most accurate analyses and
                  predictions and see them received with scornful grins and
                  affectations of Olympic superiority &#8211; a classic emblem
                  of ignorant unpreparedness &#8211; I recall that as early as
                  2005, fifteen years after the founding of the S&atilde;o Paulo
                  Forum, by then the almost absolute lord of continental policy,
                  the most enlightened council of the CFR would refuse to
                  believe in the very existence of this organization. One day,
                  some thirty or forty years from now, we shall know whether
                  this display of blindness was the fruit of genuine stupidity
                  or the clever action of enlightened intellectuals. Politics,
                  of course, is a game of disguises. But one cannot handle
                  disguises if one does not keep away from them, firmly anchored
                  in reality. At the end of the day, those who get accustomed to
                  living from disguises end up contaminating themselves with an
                  abhorrent terror of reality: their vain boasting of realism,
                  maturity and pragmatic wisdom is a grotesque pantomime that
                  conceals its own total incapability of effective action. While
                  granting them the illusory power of manipulating shadows
                  within shadows, it changes them into shadows themselves.
