            <div> Note&#8212;Last Saturday, my son Pedro and a friend of his were 
              verbally abused and threatened with physical aggression by a group 
              of more than twenty Obamaniacs in downtown Richmond, Virginia, for 
              the simple reason that my son's friend wore a McCain-Palin T-shirt. 
              They were able to escape in my son's car, but were chased for several 
              blocks by the group of fanatics. This is change we can believe in.

              Ch&aacute;vez</a>, and by all anti-American, pro-Communist, and 
              pro-terrorist forces of the world, without any visible exception. 
            <p>It is exactly as if, at the height of the Vietnam War, America 
              had elected a Ho-Chi-Minh sweetheart to the White House.
            <p>Yet, if you dare to suggest, even mildly, that so many enemies 
              of the United States are in favor of Obama because he must be at 
              least a tiny bit in favor of them, half of the American voters will 
              say you are a hopeless racist, and a goodly portion of the other 
              half will call you deranged, paranoid, and a conspiracy theorist.
            <p>It is forbidden to apply to Obama the old common sense rule, &#8220;The 
              friend of my enemy is my enemy.&#8221; In order to prove their sanity, 
              Americans must piously believe that Obama will do nothing, absolutely 
              nothing in favor of Communists and Islamofascists who love him, 
              but will do everything to defend the nation that he called &#8220;<a href="%20http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=79533">Nazi</a>&#8221; 
              and the Constitution, which, according to him, is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11OhmY1obS4">cause 
              of terrible evils</a>. 
            <p>If you think that the wager on the Obamic faith is too high and 
              that it would be more prudent to take a closer look at his life, 
              you should realize that this has become practically impossible. 
              He has blocked access, in the United States and in Kenya, to all 
              his documents,<a href="#nota3"><font size="2">3</font></a><a name="3" id="3"></a> 
              even the ones dealing with his public life, from his birth certificate 
              to the list of small donors to his campaign, including his student 
              records at Harvard and Columbia, which are at the same time invoked 
              as definitive evidence of his towering intellectual gifts, denied 
              only, it is clear, by stubborn racists. The media deems an insult 
              and a sick presumption any attempt to examine these papers, and 
              three courts, from <a href="http://bobmccarty.com/2008/10/25/obama-citizenship-lawsuit-tossed-scotus-next/">Pennsylvania</a>, 
              <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/6420ap_wa_obama_citizenship.html">Washington</a>, 
              and <a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20081031/NEWS0106/810310417/1055/NEWS">Ohio</a>, 
              have already ruled that the common citizen has no right to question 
              even the nationality of Barack Hussein Obama. One must trust his 
              word or take leave of decent society. 
            <p>But his words do not elucidate anything. He has already made up 
              so many phony stories about his life (that he was a member of the 
              Senate Banking Committee, that his uncle liberated Auschwitz, that 
              his father was a goat shepherd), he has already omitted so much 
              essential data, (that he was a member of a Socialist party, that 
              the genocidal Raila Odinga is his cousin, that he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7176683.stm">campaigned 
              for Odinga</a> in Kenya, that his brother is starving in a slum 
              in Mombasa, that his aunt is an illegal alien in the United States), 
              and he has concealed is such a way his connections with <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDZiMjkwMDczZWI5ODdjOWYxZTIzZGIyNzEyMjE0ODI=">ACORN</a> 
              and with terrorist <a href="http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/08/26/newly-released-documents-highlight-obamas-relationship-with-ayers/">William 
              Ayers</a>, Islamic agitator <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/timmerman/farrakhan_obama_islam/2008/11/01/146685.html?s=al&promo_code=6F79-1">Louis 
              Farrakhan</a>, and the crook <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?pageId=79390">Tony 
              Rezko</a>, etc.&#8212;that to try to uncover his true biography 
              is almost an impossible mission. His own book of memories, which 
              won him literary fame, is of dubious authorship. Computerized tests 
              in an authorship investigation concluded that the book was not written 
              by Obama, but <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?pageId=79403">by 
              William Ayers</a>. 
            <p>As a last resort, one can try to find something about Obama through 
              witnesses. It is interesting what they tell. The <a href="http://countryfirst.bravehost.com/grandmaO/Obama%20Affidavit%20of%20Kweli%20Shuhubia10302008corrA.pdf">grandmother 
              says that he was born in Kenya</a> and not in Hawaii, as he claims. 
              His Kenyan brothers say that he is a Muslim and not a Christian 
              as he claims. His sister says that he was born in one hospital, 
              while he claims to have been born in another one. The sponsor of 
              his studies in Harvard says that the money was provided by a well-known 
              pro-terrorism agitator. Old friends say that <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?pageId=79467">he 
              was always with Frank Marshall Davis</a> when Davis was selling 
              cocaine. Up to now, the only witness to be seriously disproved was 
              a nutcase from Minnesota who said he had sexual relations with then 
              Senator Barack Obama&#8212;which, if true, would not raise a shred 
              of the risk to national security contained in the other depositions. 
            <p>At this point, you may ask, &#8220;But why will voters trust the 
              word of someone who has no credibility, whose birthplace is not 
              known for certain, who hides two-thirds of his life and lies about 
              the other third, who is loved by all those who hate the United States 
              and clumsily conceals his affections for their friends?&#8221; In 
              Brazil you can ask that, but if you are in the United States, ask 
              it in a whisper. If you dare to display your suspicions in a very 
              audible way, the government will investigate your records, in search 
              of heinous crimes such as tax dues and unpaid traffic tickets, as 
              it did to <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/10/24/joe.html?sid=101">Joe 
              the Plumber</a>. Or it will send you to jail, as it did to <a href="www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=79513">Brent 
              Garner</a>, from Lawrence, Kansas. You also run the risk of having 
              your garage vandalized<a href="#nota4"><font size="2">4</font></a><a name="4" id="4"></a> 
              or of being beaten, as happened to some Republican activists.<a href="#nota5"><font size="2">5</font></a><a name="5" id="5"></a> 
            <p>The answer to the question on the motives of such groundless trust 
              comprises four elements:
            <p>1. The big media, almost entirely owned by Obama's supporters and 
              sponsors, does not publish anything grievous that is known about 
              him, but makes an awful uproar about the slightest trivia that may 
              hurt the image of his adversaries.<a href="#nota6"><font size="2">6</font></a><a name="6" id="6"></a> 
              The double standard, which began in newspapers and TV, ended up 
              permeating all of whole society as a normal habit. Example I: A 
              hanged dummy of Sarah Palin was greeted by the police itself as 
              an innocent and good-humored prank. In the following day, two kids 
              manufactured a dummy of a hanged Obama&#8212;and <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?pageId=79437">they 
              were arrested</a>. Example II: The young Republican activist Ashley 
              Todd, after claiming to have been robbed, spanked, and cut with 
              a razor with a letter &#8220;B&#8221; on her right cheek as soon 
              as her attacker noticed her McCain campaign button, suffered a barrage 
              of insults from the media, and very quickly changed her mind and 
              swore that she had made up the whole story. Ashley did not explain 
              whether she had only been robbed and spanked, and made herself the 
              cut on her face, or if there was only spanking, with no robbery 
              or cuts, or if nothing at all happened, and she hit herself until 
              she got a black eye and, not satisfied with the result, proceeded 
              to carve a &#8220;B&#8221; on her own face. Even though her brief 
              and inconsistent recantation sounded much more unbelievable than 
              the original story, it was promptly accepted as final truth by the 
              whole media. No more questions were asked, and it was thus proved 
              that Republicans are mean enough to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9411R800&show_article=1">disfigure 
              their own face</a> only to lay the blame on a black man and, indirectly, 
              on the most holy Barack Obama. Example III: Signs of violence against 
              the Obama campaign had been missing, but were soon delivered. Two 
              young <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE49Q7KJ20081028">skinheads 
              who entertained thoughts of shooting Obama</a>, without taking any 
              action to that purpose, were denounced by their own mother. Even 
              though it is virtually impossible to find a single skinhead in Evangelical 
              assemblies, Catholic masses, Republican conventions, or at the Hudson 
              Institute or Heritage Foundation, the fact is: if you wish to be 
              considered <em>Homo sapiens</em> instead of a <em>Pithecanthropus 
              erectus</em>, you must swear that the plan of those two idiots provides 
              ultimate proof that the American conservative movement is racist, 
              Nazist, and murderous by nature. </p>
            <p>2. American society believes in the big media because it is not 
              capable of imagining a general and systematic scam like the one 
              that took place in Brazil when all newspapers and TV stations concealed 
              on purpose, for sixteen years, the existence of the S&atilde;o Paulo 
              Forum, the largest enterprise of political delinquency that ever 
              existed in Latin America. As in the title of the famous Sinclair 
              Lewis&#8217;s novel, everybody believes that <em>It Can't Happen 
              Here</em>. Well, it happened.</p>
            <p>3. Whatever one says against Obama meets an automatic response: 
              it is racism. Racial blackmailing is so violent, generalized and 
              systematic that the simple fact of saying that there is racial blackmailing 
              proves that you are a racist. Therefore, the monopoly of verbal 
              violence remains with the Democrats, while Obama's critics retreat 
              behind self-limiting innuendos.</p>
            <p>4. What Obama says does not make sense. His speeches, when not 
              totally devoid of content, unceremoniously contradict themselves, 
              and that is exactly why they work so well. Their content has no 
              importance at all. It is just a filler for the active substance, 
              which is constituted of magic appeals and hypnotic messages, in 
              such a way that after a few minutes everyone's intelligence is numbed 
              to the point of accepting, without the least critical reaction, 
              statements such as: &#8220;You will see a light shining from above. 
              You will experience an epiphany and an inner voice will tell you: 
              &#8216;I must vote for Barack Obama&#8217;.&#8221; If he proclaimed 
              this by spontaneous faith, he would be called a madman. But as he 
              says it in the best style of Ericksonian Neuro-Linguistic Programming, 
              people will vote for him for president of the most powerful nation 
              in the world.</p>
            <p>The combined effects of these four factors are almost miracles 
              of faith, of an atrocious surrealistic character: polls show that 
              three out of four Americans who live in Israel prefer John McCain, 
              but three out of every four Jews residing in the United States, 
              away from Palestinian bombs and close to a TV tuned to CNN, prefer 
              Obama.<a href="#nota7"><font size="2">7</font></a><a name="7" id="7"></a>
