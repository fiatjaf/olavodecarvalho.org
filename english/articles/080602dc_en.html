          <div> 
            <p>Everyday, students, readers, and listeners send me dozens of questions, 
              and I try to answer as many as I can, but I usually decline requests 
              for religious direction, as I do not consider myself to be the prototype 
              of the most directed person in these questions. Nevertheless, there 
              is a rule of biblical interpretation &#8211; and thus also of religious 
              morality &#8211; that stems from the very nature of language, one 
              which no sane person can disagree with, though many deny it in practice 
              without knowing it.
            <p>I did not learn this rule from anybody else and likely I was not 
              the first one to discover it. After wandering in the minds of believers 
              through the millennia, it ended up popping up in mine, spontaneously, 
              a certain morning, after I had prayed for months to Our Lord Jesus 
              Christ that He would make His words more intelligible to a jackass 
              like me. So I have my reasons to believe that He, Himself, without 
              my noticing it, programmed my brain to accept it. To saints, prophets 
              and illuminated souls, God speaks in a loud voice or in dreams. 
              But donkeys and cranks of my kind can only learn in a state of deep 
              sleep, when we rest totally unconscious and defenseless in the arms 
              of the Lord, as little ones, and for some moments, without any merit 
              on our part, we enjoy a privilege reserved to them. I have followed 
              this rule for years and infallibly it makes things ever more clear 
              to me, be it in deciphering passages of the Bible, be it in the 
              resolution of the perplexities of life. Moreover, the rule is so 
              natural and obvious that only those who did not perceive it fail 
              to follow it.</p>
            <p>As it usually happens with the simplest truths, that which is perceived 
              in an intuitive and mute instant requires some logical refinement 
              in order to be exposed in words. To facilitate the explanation I 
              make here a distinction between &quot;norms&quot; and &quot;principles&quot; 
              &#8211; distantly inspired by the one made by Kant and Max Scheller 
              between material and formal ethics, but without subscribing to their 
              respective moral philosophies. Every moral system is made up of 
              both norms and principles. Specific norms command or forbid some 
              kind of concrete conduct: do not kill; do not steal; help orphans 
              and widows, etc. When the order is not expressed by a concrete imperative, 
              but by an abstract relationship of proportionality, as in an equation 
              of the type <em>a/b = x/y</em>, then it is not dealing with a particular 
              conduct, but rather with a principle that must be observed in all 
              conducts, in all situations of life. In order to be obeyed, specific 
              norms require distinctions and exemptions, which, based upon their 
              general typological formulation, wisely adapt them to the particular 
              situation of the moment. Of course, &quot;thou shalt not kill&quot;, 
              but whoever refuses to do it in war or in the defense of a threatened 
              innocent may have to face the guilt of exposing others to death, 
              by omission. Certainly &quot;thou shalt not steal&quot;, but who 
              has the right not to steal when the only means of getting a wounded 
              person to the hospital is the car that an unknown owner left with 
              the keys in the ignition? &quot;Thou shalt not bear false witness&quot;, 
              but this does not mean that you are forced to tell the truth when 
              a robber asks you where your boss keeps the money, or when a truculent 
              commissar of the people asks you where your village hid its harvest. 
              Having absolute typological validity, norms enjoy an eminently relative 
              application: relative to the situation, to the intentions, to the 
              character of those involved, to the interference of highly complex 
              cultural, psychological and psychopathological factors, etc. Even 
              though they are permanent in their general obligatory-ness, they 
              require a particular interpretation which is different in each case 
              and circumstance. Many times good people do evil not because they 
              consciously wish to break the moral rule, but because they err in 
              its particular interpretation.</p>
            <p>For this very reason, God did not provide us only with rules of 
              conduct, but also with the general principles that must guide their 
              interpretation. These principles, because they are as formal as 
              equations and do not refer to any concrete situation, have an absolute 
              and unconditional validity in all situations and work as a touchstone 
              to assess the interpretation we give to concrete norms. In the Ten 
              Commandments this distinction is clear. When someone asks Him what 
              is the needed to enter into heaven, Jesus answers: &quot;Thou shalt 
              love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul 
              and with thy whole mind. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; 
              The Ten Commandments are therefore made up of two principles and 
              eight rules. The principles are the keys that determine the meaning 
              of the rules in each case. If someone commits adultery, he breaks 
              a rule, but if you throw him to public execration in the streets, 
              instead of pardoning him and counseling him privately, as you would 
              hope it would be done unto you, you sin much more than the adulterer, 
              because you violate a principle. God forgives adulterers, liars, 
              thieves, and even murderers, but he does not forgive one who does 
              not forgive. I may be wrong, but I suspect that in hell there are 
              fewer adulterers than virtuous spouses who have denied them forgiveness.</p>
            <p>Throughout the Bible one finds many secondary formal principles, 
              derived from the first ones. They are authentic treasure maps to 
              the tormented soul which, in the complexities of existence, wishes 
              to do right but does not know what is right. One of these principles 
              &#8211; one that is most often forgotten, in my estimation &#8211; 
              was enunciated by St. Paul, the Apostle: &quot;Test everything; 
              retain what is good.&quot; I do not tire of meditating upon this 
              sentence, and the depth I find in it could fill many books, if I 
              were capable of writing them.</p>
            <p>Consider this. St. Paul, throughout his letters, enunciated several 
              rules of conduct, more detailed than those contained in the Ten 
              Commandments. If you read these rules, you already know what is 
              good or bad, according to the teaching of the Apostle. Whence then 
              the need to &quot;test&quot;? The very distinction between principles 
              and rules implicitly contains the answer. For you to avoid bad conduct 
              it is not enough to know that typologically, i.e. generically, it 
              falls under the classification of &quot;bad&quot;. Human conduct 
              is not guided by abstractions, but by the direct and sensitive perception 
              of situations. It is necessary for you to &quot;see&quot; with your 
              own eyes good and evil. Human beings do not learn only by hearsay 
              &#8211; even if the Word heard is God's: we learn by experience, 
              by the slow, laborious, and painful distinction between good and 
              evil not in general simple definitions, but in hallucinatingly complex 
              and ambiguous situations of real life. The symbol of bread in the 
              Eucharist means the moral, practical virtues, while the wine means 
              the spiritual ones, of a purely inner order. &quot;By the sweat 
              of your face shall you get bread to eat&quot; means exactly this: 
              the little good that may be found in us comes mixed with evil, and 
              will have to be separated from it little by little, through experience, 
              through trial and error, as in a long alchemic decantation. God 
              can, of course, preserve you from committing this or that sin by 
              an act of Grace, but He is not obliged to do so and even less is 
              He bound to immunize you beforehand against all possible sin. Moreover, 
              what greater Grace can you receive from God than His promise to 
              justify errors as soon as in the path of experience they are frankly 
              admitted as such?</p>
            <p>If the Apostle distinguishes between the experience and its selective 
              conclusion, he presupposes that not everything that will be tested 
              will be good, but that everything must be tested in light of learning 
              and of good, not out of the vulgar wish to try it just for trying, 
              neither out of a forged and artificial doubt. Plato said that &quot;the 
              truth you know is the truth you obey.&quot; As soon as you have 
              clearly seen that some conduct is bad you have to avoid it by all 
              means. Until then, you have a certain margin of justified error, 
              as an inherent requirement to the very notion of learning, with 
              the condition that you confess the error as soon as you notice it 
              as such and that you do not insist upon it after that. When you 
              have discovered what is good, do not let go of it for all the money 
              in the world.</p>
            <p>I, who am dumb and worthless, and on top of that also careless 
              and lazy, have seen a very tiny piece of good, one that compared 
              to my illustrious self is about the size of infinity. I saw it thanks 
              to the Pauline counsel. It is from there that the stable and serious 
              part of my soul comes from, a minute part, but much better than 
              the whole of it, which I hope to improve little by little to the 
              last day, as other pieces of good shine through here and there in 
              the obscurities of my mind. Certainly, I proceed by steps. I am 
              patient and tolerant with myself while amidst confusion and doubt, 
              but as soon as I see things clearly, I do not cut my wretched self 
              any slack. In an instant I shift from the tenderness of caresses 
              to the rigor of the ferule.</p>
            <p>I do not know another method and I do not recommend this one to 
              those who know a better one. To the others, I say with the Apostle: 
              test everything.</p>
