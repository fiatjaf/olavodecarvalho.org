                  Barack Hussein Obama is, in so many aspects, so different from
                  what one normally assumes to be a candidate to the presidency
                  of the U.S. that only by an enormous stretch of the
                  imagination could anyone think that the most significant
                  detail about him is the color of his skin. The motto of his
                  campaign is &#8220;change&#8221;, but to bring it about he
                  needs not even get elected: he has already changed everything
                  about the electoral ways and customs of the American people,
                  and he has changed it so much for the worse that many decades
                  will be necessary to repair the damage, if indeed that is
                  possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For one thing, he is the first candidate without any
                  administrative experience - and with below-minimal political
                  experience - to be accepted by any party to run for such a
                  high office. He also had no military or professional
                  experience, except as an NGO operative. But if you tell that
                  to an Obamaniac, they will invariably answer:
                  &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221; The natural sense
                  of strangeness about what is truly odd has become
                  anti-natural, offensive and intolerable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the possible exception of Brazilian president Lula, whose
                  ignorance was actually praised as a superior form of wisdom,
                  never has so little been demanded of one seeking maximum
                  authority. Even in Third World countries, the bearer of such
                  an insignificant resume would hardly be accepted as a
                  candidate for the top public office. In the Democratic Party
                  and U.S. big media, nobody seems to find anything strange
                  about Obama. Even among supporters of John McCain there is
                  some sort of tacit agreement not to hurt the opponent&#8217;s
                  feelings with demands beyond his capacity. Everyone prefers to
                  ask: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, the candidate lacks not only a resume but even a
                  trustworthy biography. Suggestions that he is a Muslim in
                  disguise pop up every day, but their quantity seems to be
                  inversely proportional to the interest that his adversary and
                  the big media have in clarifying the matter. All seem to want
                  the electorate to accept as utterly normal and unproblematic
                  the hypothesis of voting for an unknown candidate who conceals
                  his origins, even if these somehow connect him to the enemy
                  that is fighting his country in the battlefield, and even if
                  his dedication to covering up his past prompts him to hide his
                  own birth certificate. Evidence of the candidate&#8217;s
                  proximity to communist and pro-terrorist organizations is
                  piling up, but raises nary a shred of curiosity among
                  <em>bien-pensants</em>. After all, what&#8217;s wrong with
                  that?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even in the most elementary issue of respect for national
                  symbols - the minimum of etiquette that candidates from all
                  parties have always observed - Obama seems to have acquired
                  the right to mess everything up, without any hint from the
                  establishment that they are offended by it. He listens to the
                  Star-Spangled Banner with his hands on his genitals, and not
                  on his heart, he tampers with the national coat of arms and
                  turns it into a grotesque electoral ad, and, to top it all
                  off, he says that the flag of the country he wishes to
                  represent before the world is &#8220;to many people a symbol
                  of violence.&#8221; But if you think about it, what&#8217;s
                  wrong with that?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Still, it is in violating the law with an innocent face that
                  the candidate displays the kind of absolute trust in his own
                  invulnerability that is so typical of revolutionary
                  sociopaths. Every week new abuses turn up that would normally
                  be enough to destroy the career of any politician or, worse,
                  send him to jail. But Obama seems to be immunized to the
                  consequences of his actions. This week&#8217;s latest abuses
                  were: (1) To collect funds for his campaign, he organized a
                  lottery system - which is illegal in all 50 American states.
                  (2) He flies everywhere in an airplane that does not meet the
                  required security standards, and was recently forced to make
                  an emergency landing. But again, the general reaction is the
                  same: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Obama is so utterly weird that apparently the only way to
                  attenuate the embarrassment of his presence in the
                  presidential contest is to pretend that he is normal. But the
                  prohibition of finding anything odd is truly a prohibition of
                  the act of understanding, a veto against the formal exercise
                  of intelligence. The readiness to accept this imposition
                  reveals an alarming weakness of character and the almost
                  diabolical effectiveness of the &#8220;politically
                  correct&#8221; blackmail that produced it.
