          <p>
            The 20th century thought itself very smart because it discovered,
            with Marx, Freud and Nietzsche, that the highest human qualities
            could cover prejudices of class, repressed desires and the search
            for compensations for resentment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In light of these revelations, the image of the great men the
            previous centuries had exalted shattered into a dust cloud of small
            miseries, to such a degree that it has become necessary to explain
            their feats and notable works as imaginary projections of their
            cultural environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end of the century, it has become a fad in academic circles
            to produce pejorative biographies, committed to bringing up the
            sins, flaws and blind spots in the souls of the best individuals, so
            as to suggest to the masses of readers that in those characters
            nothing special existed that had not been put there by fame&#146;s
            serendipity, by a well-orchestrated marketing campaign or by a
            convergence of arrangements convenient to the interests of the
            dominant class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having taken then to extreme consequences the modern impulse to
            delight in masochistic self-corrosion, the 20th century seemed not
            to have a greater motive for pride than its stubborn suspiciousness
            which made it, after so many centuries of dreams and delusions, the
            first not to allow self-deceit.
          </p>
          <p>
            This bizarre cold-eyed arrogance, which rejoices in the
            contemplation of its own misery because doing so invests its bearer
            with the sovereign power of undoing with a laconic statement the
            highest values and hopes, is the perfect inversion of Christian
            humility, which only searches out its own sins with such rigidity so
            as to through them exalt the glory of Divine healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the Christian humiliates himself so God may exalt him, modern
            man humiliates himself to humiliate others. God frightens us because
            He keeps in His hands, and not in ours, the secret of salvation; the
            discourse of modernity scares us because it persuades us that it
            holds the ultimate secret that there is no salvation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model of supreme wisdom to which modern intelligentsia aspires
            is certainly the devil. He cannot save us; but he can justify our
            damnation in ever increasingly scientific ways. This demonic
            ascension has become so disseminated and obligatory in the academic
            environment, that it has practically identified itself with the
            image of scientific knowledge in general, to the point that, when
            one speaks of faith and charity nowadays, it is often under the tone
            of some paternalistic concession that intellectual rigidity makes to
            childish needs of consolation and illusion unsurpassable by that
            majority of the population who has not yet reached the highest
            levels of conscience reserved for academics with cold eyes and
            mocking grins.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was in an advanced stage of this development that the idea
            emerged to crumble, after the divine images, the very human
            qualities that manifested them. The attraction exercised over the
            masses of ordinary readers by the pejorative biographies and the
            insulting diagnoses of the psyche of great men can be easily
            explained by the mechanism of seduction. &#147;Seduction&#148;
            derives from the Latin <i>sub ducere</i>, &#147;conduction or
            attraction from below&#148;: dominating the mind of a subject by
            appealing to his worst qualities, to his weaknesses and his fears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above all to envy. Envy is a feeling of inferiority which finds
            relief in the contemplation of others&#146; real or imaginary
            inferiority. Incapable of overcoming his own weaknesses, the envious
            man finds consolation in the idea that everybody has such flaws in
            equal measure. It is the democracy of complexes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This kind of academic literature aims at awakening in the reader
            that which John Le Carr&eacute; called &#147;typical corrosive
            perception of the weak&#148;. To have disseminated such a thing
            among the educated classes made the 20th century feel particularly
            smart.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what will seem supremely na&iuml;ve to future historians is that
            such vast numbers among the educated classes of a certain age
            believed in the possibility of apprehending the personality and the
            genius of a Goethe, of a Shakespeare &#150; and that is not to
            mention saints and prophets &#150; through the examination of the
            flaws and sins they had in common with the rest of humankind,
            without taking into account what they had that was different. If
            their weaknesses are precisely the same as everybody else&#146;s, it
            still needs to be explained why not everybody manages to write
            &#147;Faust&#148; or &#147;Hamlet&#148; &#150; and much less operate
            miraculous healings or make prophecies confirmed by time.
          </p>
          <p>
            To relieve the stress of this uncomfortable question, academic
            engineering conceived theories such as desconstrutivism and the
            aesthetic of reception, which, deviating the attention of the
            readers from the structural unity in which the superior meaning of
            the great works is apprehended, dispersed their intelligence in the
            contemplation of the infinity of separated elements that compose
            them or the inexhaustible variety of reactions that the public of
            various times and places had to these works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invariably, to the dispersion of intelligence follows the crumbling
            of the object: in the end what is negated is the very integrity of
            the works, which is the same as saying: their very existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            By these means, the uncomfortable feeling mentioned above is
            definitely solved, since no one can feel humiliated by what does not
            exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            That thousands of envious people around the world should give in so
            easily to the temptation of this cheap relief and piously believe in
            childish intellectual tricks conceived to obtain it, is what will
            make of the 20th century, in the vision of times to come, the most
            na&iuml;ve century of History.
