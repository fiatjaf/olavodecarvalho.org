            If the media would expose in equal doses the information that comes
            from both sides, that should be enough to have the majority of the
            readers condemn the &#147;pacifist&#148; campaign as the sordid act
            of war camouflaged in pretty words that it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent that, the information from the American side is shown
            chopped off or completely omitted, while the hysterical shouting of
            the marches echoes around the world as if it was the pure voice of
            reason and goodness, clean from every intention lower than angelic.
            Of course: only the most elevated ethical feelings could produce the
            miracle of putting together the hard line communist Brian Becker,
            the radical muslim assassin Mumia Abu-Jamal and the Nazi leader
            David Duke in a harmonic effusion of unbearable love for peace. The
            names of these feelings are: anti-Americanism, anti-Semitism and
            anti-Christianism.
          </p>
          <p>
            But none of this can be known by the Brazilian reader. The space in
            the newspaper for pros and cons is distributed in a monstrously
            unequal way, making the national media a propaganda machine
            dedicated to protect the kindly Saddam Hussein, murderer of 200
            thousand political prisoners, against evil George W. Bush.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as an example, the national media are altogether denying to
            their readers the essential information regarding the
            &#147;pacifist&#148; manifestations: the NGO that promotes them,
            A.N.S.W.E.R. International, is the fa&ccedil;ade organization of the
            World Workers Party, which is noting but the international branch of
            North Korea&#146;s Communist Party &#150; the party of the genocidal
            Kim Il Jung.
          </p>
          <p>
            A.N.S.W.E.R. (<i>Act Now to Stop War and End Racism</i>) coordinates
            a world network of NGOs and can in a few hours produce mass
            movements in different parts of the planet, giving the impression of
            spontaneous popular reaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of money that is involved in this is so large that
            A.N.S.W.E.R. spreads ads around the world calling volunteers to work
            in organizing protests in the US. Do you have any idea of how much
            it costs to provide transportation, housing, food and training to
            tens of thousands of volunteers who come from different countries
            (Brazil included)? Part of the budget comes from the traditional
            sponsors of communism, and part from the slave work of millions of
            people, the same ones whose sweat and blood pay for the atomic bombs
            that Kim Il Jung, as he has already announced, will throw at the US
            at the first alarm signal.
          </p>
          <p>
            No adult human being has the right to ignore the fact that all
            pacifist movements of the 20th century, without exception, were
            organized by totalitarian states to disarm and destabilize
            democratic states. And nobody who knows this fact has the right to
            suppose, <i>a priori</i>, that the current movement would be an
            exception.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above all, it is good to remember the effect of pacifism in the 60s
            which, by taking the American troops out of Vietnam, left it, and
            Cambodia, ready for the communist occupation; the consequence being
            the genocide of no less than three million people, three times more
            than the number of those who had died in the war. And no enthusiast
            of the &#147;flower power&#148; movement has ever repented for
            having helped to create such murderer peace.
