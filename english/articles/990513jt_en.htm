            (Marilena Chau&iacute;, <i>Dialogue with Bento Prado Jr.</i>,

            &#147;Living free of guilt&#148; is an objective that all
            progressive culture offers to humanity. The feeling of guilt is
            condemned as the residue of old repressive traditions, which must be
            abandoned at the gates of a new era of happiness and
            self-realization. This is a point of agreement among the adepts of
            the most opposite trends. Crystallized by consensus, the
            condemnation of guilt has so many varied justifications that,
            actually, none of them is necessary anymore and people live
            perfectly well with something self-evident that needs no
            argumentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, what is, precisely, living free of guilt? Above all, which is
            the precise tone intended by those who suggest such an objective?
          </p>
          <p>
            There are only three senses in which a human being can be said to be
            free of guilt. The first hypothesis is that of innocence, the
            effective innocence of Adam in Paradise, of the Good Savage or of
            childhood in a Disney movie. Both the <i>Bible</i> and Rousseau,
            being very careful, put that hypothesis in a mythic past. Saint
            Augustine confessed to have been perverse since the cradle and what
            little credibility could be given to the image of childlike
            innocence was mercilessly demoralized by Dr. Freud.
          </p>
          <p>
            The desire to &#147;live free of guilt&#148; would not be the least
            bit attractive to the soul if it appealed to a discredited idea. It
            is not possible, therefore, that it is primordial innocence that
            modern progressism has in mind when it invites us to &#147;live free
            of guilt&#148;. Complete and absolute innocence is a myth, a divine
            quality no one can achieve in this world.
          </p>
          <p>
            A second sense in which is possible to &#147;live without
            guilt&#148; is that of the relative innocence, arduous and unstable,
            which man manages to maintain when he consciously abstains from
            doing evil and, if he does, tries to remediate it with devoted
            goodwill. It is a norm of reasonable perfection at the reach of many
            human beings.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that cannot be the meaning of &#147;living free of guilt&#148;,
            for the possibility of a person rectifying any harm done is entirely
            based on the feeling of guilt that comes over him when he sins; and
            to prevent his doing new harm, he must conceive in imagination the
            guilt he would feel if he actually did it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that sense, relative innocence is in no way living free of guilt;
            it is precisely, giving value to the feeling of guilt as a compass
            that guides us away from evil.
          </p>
          <p>
            But &#147;living free of guilt&#148; can mean still a third thing:
            it can mean the pure and simple abolition of the concept of guilt.
            In that case, whatever the individual does, his acts will not be
            examined under the category of guilt, repentance, of penalties and
            reparation. Since the nature of such acts and their consequences to
            others do not matter, they will always be approached in a way that
            strives to avoid the embarrassing constraint of a moral remediation.
            They can then be explained sociologically, psychologically,
            pragmatically, they can be evaluated in terms of advantage or
            disadvantage, described in terms of wish, gratification and
            frustration. They just cannot be judged.
          </p>
          <p>
            This last meaning is, with all the evidence, the only one in which
            it is possible, in practice, to &#147;live free of guilt&#148;. It
            is this meaning, clearly, that the modern ideologists have in mind
            when they offer to humanity this ideal for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, in the present, we already have people who live without guilt,
            who do not submit to the examination of moral consciousness, who are
            not constrained by what harm their actions might cause to others.
            They are called sociopaths. They are not mentally ill or retarded.
            They are intelligent individuals, not rarely gifted with a certain
            geniality and impressive social ability, who merely lack the moral
            sensibility to feel guilty for their actions. Among them are
            muggers, drug dealers, gang leaders &#150; and all the leaders of
            totalitarian movements, without exception. Anyone who wishes to be
            like them feels his heart beat faster, full of hope, when he hears
            someone announce that it is possible to live free of guilt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our civilization started when Christ said to the apostle: &#147;Take
            up thy cross and follow me&#148;. Two millennia after, the ideal
            that is announced is to throw the cross away, not being important
            who it may fall on, for we should rush to jump on the bandwagon of
            History, not being important who it will crush on the way.
