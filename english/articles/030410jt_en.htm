            Deputy Alberto Fraga&#146;s (PMDB-DF) denuciation that the current
            president of the Republic got elected with financial help from the
            Farc only came to the knowledge of some readers because, breaking
            through the general blockade, I gave the news in my article. That
            part of the public who did not read it still ignores the issue,
            although the CPI (Investigative Parliamentary Committee) called by
            the deputy to clarify the case already counts with the support of
            114 parliament members, in need of only 58 more signatures to start
            the most explosive public investigation ever made in this country.

            Few events in the last month had the spotlight as much in our
            newspapers and TV news programs as the anti-US marches. But, since
            the beginning of March, huge pro-Bush manifestations have been
            happening in numerous American cities, without one, not even one
            word about it being mentioned in the Brazilian media.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a decade, hundreds of books and articles, filled with
            statistical proof, denounced the existence of a liberal bias in the
            American media &#150; and not one word about it was written in our
            newspapers. But as soon as the leftist Eric Alterman decided to
            mumble against that criticism, he was immediately flattered in the
            Brazilian press, which, to make things worse translated
            &#147;liberal bias&#148; as &#147;vi&eacute;s liberal&#148; instead
            of &#147;vi&eacute;s esquerdista&#148;.<sup

            These examples are enough to show to which point the public in this
            country is deprived of basic information and deceived on a daily
            basis by an army of journalists without scruples, subservient
            collaborators of the international machine of totalitarian
            misinformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, not being satisfied by closing the borders of the country to
            news or ideas that might contradict the dominant orthodoxy, these
            people still have the guts to add flattery to the lies, leading
            Brazilians to think that the misinformed ones are not them, but...
            the Americans! Articles and reports, in a dazzling succession, force
            on our compatriots the concept that the truth about Iraq is known
            only by them, while the US news agencies are under the iron fisted
            censorship of George W. Bush, publishing only what he wants. And,
            the Brazilians, increasingly provincial day by day, do believe.

            The new normative model for Brazil is Mohammed Al-Sahaf &#150; the
            Iraqi Minister of Information who told us about the complete
            expulsion of the Americans from Baghdad while, precisely at the same
            time, they were peeing in Saddam Hussein&#146;s presidential
            toilet.<sup><a name="2" href="#nota2">2</a></sup>

            It is true that I, personally, still have some room to protest. But
            how many readers will have the intellectual courage to consider the
            hypothesis that an isolated journalist tells the truth, while the
            whole rest of the class lies? Such independence of thought is not
            demanded of the masses, who trust the educated elite like school
            boys trust their teachers. Antonio Gramsci was right when he
            considered that a couple of intellectuals were more useful to the
            communist cause than a multitude of proletarians. He used to say
            that once the conscience of the masses had been conquered by the
            leftist elite, not even censorship would be necessary: anyone who
            would contradict the majority would be considered mad. And, in this
            case, of course, the mad one is me. Al-Sahaf is the normal one.
          </p>

            It is true also that in the <i>Jornal da Tarde</i> I am not alone.
            Here we have J.O. de Meira Penna, Alberto Oliva and a few more
            outsiders. But that only makes this newspaper the exception that
            confirms the rule.
          </p>

            A brief opinion poll in the Brazilian editorials would be enough to
            show that there, instead of a proportional representation of the
            many political options that are necessary to keep an impartial
            coverage of the facts, what we find is a depressing ideological
            uniformity: &#147;right-winged&#148; journalists are inexistent
            &#150; and things have been like this for so long that nobody sees
            anything abnormal in that.
          </p>
          <p>It is the normality of Al-Sahaf.</p>
          <p>
            That, of course, does not mean that everything that is published is
            praising the government. On the contrary, there is a lot of debate
            amongst leftists, and the transposition of these debates to the
            papers provides a verisimilar illusion of democracy. But this merely
            reflects the &#147;strategy of scissors&#148; conceived by Lenin, in
            which the internal divergences of the left slowly take the place of
            the real pluralism, addicting the public to a bionic mockery of
            freedom and reducing all non-leftist parties to ornamental
            appendices for some factions of the left, until the day they become
            useless and disappear.

              <a name="nota1"><i>Liberal</i></a
              >, in the US means leftist. Besides the conservatives, there is
              still a third political ideology which is called libertarians. In
              UK, the word &#147;liberal&#148; is still used for that group that
              the Americans call &#147;libertarians&#148;. The Portuguese
              language refers to these political ideologies in the same terms of
              British English, therefore: Conservatives = <i>Conservadores</i>,
              Leftists = <i>Esquerdistas</i>, Liberals = <i>Liberais</i>.
              Translating from American English we would have in Portuguese:
              Conservatives = <i>Conservadores</i>, Liberals =
              <i>Esquerdistas</i>, Libertatians = <i>Liberais</i>. The
              translation made by the Brazilian newspapers, then, is either too
              incompetent, not understanding even the basic terms of the topic
              it will discuss, or it is plainly a lie made to misinform and
              cultivate the myth of &#147;neoliberal&#148; evil. &#150;
