                  Since the Algerian war (1954-1962), the idea of an
                  &#8220;asymmetric war&#8221; became the guiding principle of
                  the anti-West strategy. Inspired on the &#8220;indirect
                  combat&#8221; of Sun-Tzu &#8211; whose &#8220;The Art of
                  War&#8221; already circulated in official editions in the USSR
                  and its satellites in the 1950s &#8211;, the concept is
                  essentially that of a fight in which one of the contending
                  parties does not admit any kind of constraints to its actions.
                  It may do whatever it pleases and still use as a weapon the
                  moral , legal and social commitments that tie the hands of its
                  adversary. It is the military expression of the adage
                  formulated in 1792 by delegate Collot d'Herbois at the French
                  Convention: &#8220;<em
                    >Everything is permitted to those who act in favor of the
                    revolution.</em
                  >&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>
                  A strategic analyst, Canadian navy commander Hugues
                  Letourneau, remarks that the Algerian National Liberation
                  Front usually resorted to &#8220;<em
                    >general strikes, ambush, terrorism against its own
                    population and against other Algerian organizations of
                    liberation, assassination, torture, mutilation,
                    appropriation of great amounts of money from the civil
                    population, industrial and agricultural sabotage,
                    destruction of public goods, intimidation and assassination
                    of presumed collaborationists, disinformation campaigns,
                    etc.</em
                  >&#8221; Meanwhile, the slightest illegal act on the part of
                  occupation forces was used, by activist intellectuals in Paris
                  , as an instrument of moral blackmail designed to keep the
                  French government paralyzed by fear of a scandal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to achieve its goal, the asymmetry must impregnate
                  itself deeply in the judgment habits of people, so that public
                  opinion does not detect the intrinsic immorality of the
                  supposedly moral demands that it exacts from one of the
                  disputing parties, while granting to the other the benefit of
                  an indifferent or complicit silence. One example is the
                  unevenness in the treatment given to the occupations in Iraq
                  and Tibet, directed in a way to instill the public with the
                  impression that a temporary military operation - calculated as
                  no other before in history to avoid damages to the civilian
                  population - is a more serious crime than the continuous
                  occupation, the premeditated destruction of a 1000-year-old
                  culture, and the permanent genocide that has already made one
                  million victims. The asymmetry, in this case, has become so
                  normal and obligatory that the simple suggestion of comparing
                  the American behavior to the Chinese already sounds not only
                  extemporaneous, but also in bad taste and suspect of some
                  questionable connection with &#8220;shady interests&#8221;,
                  invariably &#8220;paid for by Wall Street&#8221; (this very
                  article obviously falling under this category!). Likewise,
                  half a dozen bloody abuses committed by American soldiers in
                  Iraq - which are inevitable in any war, even under a strict
                  oversight of the troops &#8211; appear in the media as more
                  heinous cruelties than the routine practice of torture and the
                  political assassination in time of peace, common in communist
                  and Islamic countries, not to mention the religious
                  persecution (which is never reported in Brazil), that has
                  already killed over two million Christians in the past few
                  decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Asymmetric war is more easily carried out by revolutionary
                  organizations, which are not accountable to the same standards
                  applied to organized States. But some States may also use that
                  same strategy. A recent book by two Chinese colonels,
                  &#8220;The War beyond the Rules&#8221;, published in 1999,
                  shows that the Chinese government is deeply involved in the
                  anti-American asymmetric war. And this war would not be
                  asymmetric if, as soon as its concept fell into public domain,
                  the responsibility for the massive recourse to its dreadful
                  techniques was not blamed upon no other than its main victim.
                  A few days after September 11, the French weekly
                  <em>Le Monde Diplomatique</em>, in undisguised hypocrisy,
                  referred to &#8220;the official American strategy of
                  asymmetric war&#8221;. It evidently failed to explain how
                  could the U.S. engage in an asymmetric war while being, at the
                  same time, the country in the world most exposed to the
                  judgment of public opinion and one which does not count with
                  an organized network of supporters &#8211; in international or
                  even in American media &#8211; as the one available to leftist
                  movements, which today are capable of imposing to the whole
                  population of the planet, in a few hours, their own version of
                  events, thus simulating a sort of spontaneous convergence.
                  &#8220;<em>The force of terrorism is the media</em>&#8221;
                  says Jacques Baud, author of &#8220;Asymmetric War or the
                  Defeat of the Vanquisher&#8221; (&#8220;<em
                    >La Guerre Asym&eacute;trique ou la D&eacute;faite du
                    Vainqueur</em
                  >&#8221;, Paris , 2003).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The whole operation gains even more efficiency when carried
                  out in a terrain which has been previously prepared by the
                  &#8220;occupation of spaces&#8221; preached by Antonio
                  Gramsci. By blocking some sources of information while
                  selecting others, it predisposes the public to accept as
                  natural and innocent the most deceiving ideological
                  manipulation in news coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Brazil , for example, access to the opinion of American
                  conservatives has been banished. Their books &#8211; thousands
                  of titles, many of them classics of political thought &#8211;
                  are never translated and cannot be found in any university
                  library. Their ideas are only available to public knowledge
                  distorted as a caricature in the official communist version,
                  created in 1971 by Soviet historian V. Nikitin in the book
                  &#8220;The Ultras in the USA &#8221;. It is still submissively
                  passed on today, from generation to generation, in schools and
                  in newspapers, by a bunch of knowing sly militants and by a
                  multitude of useful fools who do not have the least clue as to
                  the origin of their own opinions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Who, raised in this environment, can suspect that there is
                  anything wrong with the media onslaught that turns George W.
                  Bush into a sort of right-wing Stalin?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The challenge of tearing apart this blockade can be met only
                  by hardworking and learned individuals , through research
                  efforts that lie outside the reach of the average citizen. And
                  the voice of those individuals sounds ridiculously inaudible
                  when they try to warn the population against this frightening
                  reality: since the advent of the asymmetric strategy,
                  disinformation - in the technical and literal meaning of the
                  term - disinformation as a weapon of war, has become the most
                  constant and regular pursuit of big media, almost entirely
                  supplanting the task that used to be journalism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The danger to which the population is thereby submitted to is
                  indeed monstrous. It will not diminish while civil society
                  does not take upon itself to exercise an &#8220;external
                  surveillance&#8221; of the media, taking to court all those
                  who refuse to convey in a faithful and
                  <em>quantitatively balanced</em> way the information and
                  opinions coming from sources opposed to each other.
