                <p>
                  I have been presenting, in newspaper articles as well as in
                  lectures and conferences, a few conclusions of an extensive
                  study on the revolutionary mentality. Here are the chief ones:
                </p>

                <p>
                  1. The revolutionary mentality, as it appears recorded in the
                  writings and acts of every revolutionary leader since the
                  fifteenth century, without one notable exception, consists not
                  in adhering to this or that concrete politico-social proposal
                  but in a certain structure of apprehension of reality,
                  characterized by the inversion of the causal and temporal
                  order and of the subject-object relation, a variety of
                  secondary inversions deriving therefrom.
                </p>

                <p>
                  2. These inversions constitute not only a &#8220;spiritual
                  disease,&#8221; in the sense given to the term by F. W. J. von
                  Schelling and Eric Voegelin, but a mental disease in the
                  strict clinical sense. The revolutionary mentality is a
                  specific variant of &#8220;interpretation delusion,&#8221; a
                  syndrome whose pioneering description by the psychiatrists
                  Paul S&eacute;rieux and Jean Capgras was set forth in their
                  classic book
                  <em
                    >Les Folies Raisonnantes: Le D&eacute;lire
                    d&#8217;Interpr&eacute;tation</em
                  >
                  (Paris: Alcan, 1909; also available online at
                  <a
                    href="http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=61092&p=1&do=page"
                    >http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=61092&amp;p=1&amp;do=page</a
                  >).
                </p>

                <p>
                  S&eacute;rieux and Capgras remark: &#8220;While most of the
                  dementing systematized psychoses rest upon predominant and
                  almost permanent sensory disorders, all the cases that we have
                  collected under the foregoing term are, almost exclusively,
                  based upon delusional interpretations; hallucinations,
                  episodic whenever existing, play hardly any role here. . . .
                  [The interpretation delusion] is a false reasoning that has as
                  its point of departure a real sensation, an exact fact, which,
                  by virtue of associations of ideas conditional upon
                  tendencies, upon affectivity, takes on, with the aid of
                  erroneous inductions and deductions, a personal significance
                  to the patient. . . . The interpretation delusion is
                  distinguished from hallucination and from illusion, which are
                  sensory disorders. . . . [It also] differs from delusional
                  idea, an imaginary conception that is made up altogether or at
                  least not drawn from an observed fact.&#8221; It differs too,
                  according to the authors, from mere false interpretation, that
                  is, from vulgar mistake, for two reasons: First, &#8220;the
                  error is said to be, more often than not, rectifiable; the
                  delusional interpretation, incorrigible.&#8221; Second,
                  &#8220;the error remains isolated, circumscribed; the
                  delusional interpretation tends to diffuse, to radiate, it
                  associates itself with analogous ideas and organizes itself
                  into a system.&#8221;
                </p>

                <p>
                  In a subsequent article I shall explain the specific
                  difference between revolutionary mentality and the other
                  varieties of interpretation delusion. Here I intend only to
                  illustrate something that I have said and repeated dozens of
                  times: the inversion of reality is so constant and so
                  omnipresent a factor in the revolutionary thought of all
                  periods that samples of it can be found in whatever the
                  mouthpieces of revolutionary ideologies utter about subjects
                  of their political interest. A researcher has such an immense
                  amount of instances at his disposal that the only difficulty
                  for him is the <em>embarras de choix</em>, the choice of the
                  most obvious and illustrative cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I select here, at random, an article by the world-famous
                  liberation theologist Leonardo Boff published last July 14 in
                  <em>Jornal do Brasil</em> (see
                  <a
                    href="http://jbonline.terra.com.br/editorias/pais/papel/2008/07/14/pais20080714007.html"
                    >http://jbonline.terra.com.br/editorias/pais/papel/2008/07/14/pais20080714007.html</a
                  >).
                </p>

                <p>
                  Quoting Arnold Toynbee, the author says that a constant in the
                  decay of civilizations is the disruption of the balance
                  between the number of challenges and each civilization&#8217;s
                  capacity to respond. &#8220;When the challenges are such that
                  they exceed the capacity to respond, the civilization starts
                  to decline, enters in crisis, and disappears.&#8221;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Applying this concept to the description of the current state
                  of affairs, Mr. Boff says: &#8220;Our civilizational paradigm,
                  developed in the West and spread throughout the globe, is
                  everywhere failing to hold water. So severe are the global
                  challenges, especially those concerning ecology, energy, food,
                  and population, that we have lost our capacity to deliver a
                  collective and inclusive response. This kind of civilization
                  shall dissolve.&#8221;
                </p>

                <p>
                  Having reviewed, with the aid of Eric Hobsbawn and Jacques
                  Attali, some possible catastrophic developments of the
                  situation, Mr. Boff enunciates what, in his mind, is the only
                  hope left: &#8220;Mankind, if it is unwilling to destroy
                  itself, must devise a world social contract by creating global
                  governance agencies for the collective and equitable
                  management of nature&#8217;s scarce resources.&#8221; In
                  short, socialist world government.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Every fact mentioned in his article is real, but
                  systematically misplaced.
                </p>

                <p>
                  1. The challenges that Mr. Boff mentions to illustrate
                  Toynbee&#8217;s thesis do not illustrate it, failing by far to
                  bear it out. What Toynbee has in view are not such material
                  difficulties as those referred to, but above all the
                  simultaneous pressure of an &#8220;internal proletariat&#8221;
                  and of an &#8220;external proletariat,&#8221; both engaged in
                  destroying the target civilization. The former can be
                  exemplified by the illegal immigrants who receive from the
                  American government every sort of benefits (denied even to
                  legal residents) and thereby grow stronger in order to assault
                  the local culture and fight for the dismemberment of the
                  United States. The &#8220;external proletariat&#8221; is
                  represented by the multitude of organizations engrossed in a
                  violent and incessant campaign of anti-Americanism, in which
                  Mr. Boff himself, at least on the Brazilian scale, is a
                  prominent voice. The action of the two proletariats is
                  intensely promoted and subsidized by the supporters of world
                  government, who then present the ensuing debilitation of the
                  United States as an involuntary and impersonal phenomenon,
                  disguising the self-fulfilling prophecy through the appeal to
                  &#8220;historical constants.&#8221;
                </p>

                <p>
                  2. Of the four challenges adduced by Mr. Boff&#8212;ecology,
                  food, population, and energy crises&#8212;the first three
                  affect much less the West than Islamic and Communist countries
                  along with their respective spheres of influence. Never has
                  there been an ecological disaster that ranks in its effects
                  with the Chernobyl explosion or with the widespread pollution
                  in China, nor is there population drama that compares to the
                  Chinese one, nor even food shortage as scary as that observed
                  in such African countries under Islamic and Communist rule as,
                  respectively, Sudan and Zimbabwe. If ever a paradigm was
                  menaced by the three problems that Mr. Boff indicates, it is
                  the anti-Western paradigm of China, of Russia, of Islamic
                  countries. In the West, instead of overpopulation, there is
                  nowadays depopulation; instead of food shortage, endemic
                  obesity; and nowhere in the world are ecological risks,
                  whether real or imaginary, kept under such strict control as
                  in developed capitalist countries. How could a civilization be
                  under threat of imminent extinction when the challenges to it
                  are absent or under control? And how could it be
                  advantageously replaced by some &#8220;new paradigm&#8221;
                  inspired precisely by the nations that helplessly succumb to
                  these same challenges? The inversion of reality here is so
                  symmetrical, so patent, so literal, even so na&iuml;ve, that
                  one could not wish for a clearer and more didactic instance of
                  interpretation delusion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As to the energy crisis, there is none in the United States,
                  but it is a possible risk, which is becoming imminent thanks
                  to the activity of&#8212;you guessed it&#8212;those very
                  supporters of world government, the likes of Pelosi and Obama,
                  who by every possible means block new drilling, turning the
                  owner of the largest oil reserves in the world into a nation
                  dependent upon foreign suppliers. These, in their turn, with
                  the money collected from their major client, finance not only
                  propaganda campaigns but even terrorist movements against it,
                  while at the same time arming themselves to the teeth for the
                  &#8220;people&#8217;s war&#8221; (General Giap&#8217;s
                  expression adopted by Hugo Ch&aacute;vez) against the
                  &#8220;imperialist monster&#8221; that feeds them. As a result
                  of the &#8220;breakdown of the imperial
                  order&#8221;&#8212;again Mr. Boff&#8217;s
                  words&#8212;&#8220;there begins a collective process of chaos.
                  . . . Globalization continues, but balkanization predominates,
                  with regional powers that may give rise to greatly devastating
                  conflicts. . . . This extreme situation calls for an equally
                  extreme solution.&#8221; Evidently, the extreme solution is
                  the aforementioned planetary socialism.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In other words, of the four &#8220;challenges&#8221; that
                  according to Mr. Boff make Western civilization inviable and
                  call for the advent of world government, three exist only
                  among the enemies of the West, the same enemies who inoculate
                  the fourth one into it by spreading diseases in order to sell
                  medicine.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Mr. Boff, himself one of the agents in the operation, albeit
                  of a lesser kind, is aware of all this. His perception of the
                  facts is exact. It is his interpretation of the picture that
                  is altogether inverted, detail by detail, compulsively so, to
                  create a system of errors in which revolutionary perfidy may
                  look like the highest expression of good and virtue.
                </p>
