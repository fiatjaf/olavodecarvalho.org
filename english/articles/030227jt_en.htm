        <i>Jornal da Tarde</i>, February 27th, 2003</p> 
      <p>&nbsp;</p> 
      <p>The countries that have been offering the greatest resistance to the US have very good reasons to do so, since they are the greatest weapons suppliers to Saddam Hussein. A summary of the shopping list made in Moscow, Paris and Berlin can be read at <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/2/13/134858.shtml">http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/2/13/134858.shtml</a>. Germany is the fundamental source of atomic technology to Iraq, where France, on her part, has some of her main investments. Russia has 4 billion dollars to receive for the weapons she supplied to Iraq, and already feels her pocket hurting even before Saddam&#146;s fall.</p> 
      <p>Nothing of that comes out in our media. Not a word either is read about the financing of fa&ccedil;ade organizations that promote &#147;pacifist&#148; marches in 500 cities around the world. If you want to get informed read <a href="http://www.oexpressionista.com.br/reportagem_especial/">http://www.oexpressionista.com.br/reportagem_especial/</a> (in Portuguese) and praise God there is the <i>Internet</i>.</p> 
      <p>In compensation, accusations that it was the Americans who &#147;gave chemical weapons to Iraq&#148; in the Iran war sprout in the Brazilian news; but not one of the outraged accusers remembers to tell us that, at the time, the substances for the making of such weapons were not even controlled: the purchase was tranquilly made in name of the University of Baghdad through a direct order to the suppliers. The case is similar to that of the atomic bomb components freely acquired in the American market by state-owned Chinese companies. All the anti-American forces in the world make use of this double-luring: by abusing trust, they obtain in the US the means to make evil, and then blame the American government for the evil they made. The first part of the operation is carried out by spies disguised as merchants; the second, by influential agents scattered in the media and in show business. To any secret service of a totalitarian government, the articulation of military strategy and mass misinformation is an elementary work principle. But the population in general opposes to any news about it the obstinate resistance of provincial disbelief, preferring to give total credit to pathetic invented lies a la Oliver Stone.</p> 
      <p>In the same line of general misinformation, the UN is treated as the temple of good feelings, divinely hovering above vile human ambitions, and not a political power with its own interests and objectives, in reality, the most crushingly imperialist motives humanity has ever seen. Anyone who wants to know something about it, must search in books such as <i>La Face Cach&eacute;e de l&#146;ONU</i> (Paris, Sarment, 2002), by Michel A. Schooyans, <i>L&#146;Empire &eacute;cologique ou la Subversion de l&#146;&Eacute;cologie par le Mondialisme</i>, by Pascal Bernardin (Paris, &Eacute;ditions Notre-Dame des Gr&acirc;ces, 1998), and <i>The Fearful Master</i>, by E. Edward Griffin, which can be downloaded at the site <a href="http://www.getusout.org/resources/fearful_master/">http://www.getusout.org/resources/fearful_master/</a>.</p> 
      <p>The UN is today the irradiating core of the global anti-American strategy, especially through the NGOs it funds. A brief but accurate explanation about their workings was given by an experienced communist agent, Jos&eacute; Luiz Del Royo &#150; who I knew in my militant times &#150; and can be read at <a href="http://www.cubdest.org/0306/gfsm03redp.html">http://www.cubdest.org/0306/gfsm03redp.html</a>. Through these networks the communist power goes round the world, starting mass movements and media campaigns in a few hours, on every continent, deceiving the public with an impression of spontaneous unanimity.</p> 
      <p>Practically, there is no discussion in the UN that has not been lengthily prepared through the networks. A very visible case was the renowned conference of Durban, to which the US and Israel went without knowing that the stage had already been set for a general condemnation of zionism. Until the night before, the world consensus was persuaded of what Martin Luther King had said: that anti-zionism was just an elegant nickname for anti-semitism. Suddenly, out of thin air, the abhorred opinion had been subscribed and approved, officially, by the representatives of all countries but two. It was the miracle of the &#147;networks&#148;.</p> 
      <p>Particularly astonishing is what happens in our Amazonia, where practically all indigenous and ecologist NGOs hell bent on destroying our national sovereignity are the UN&#146;s tentacles, and, yet, every denunciation against them is shown in the media in scandalous anti-American tones, throwing at the victim the guilt of her aggressors.</p>
