      <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b><a name="1">WARNING 1</a> (April 6th, 2003)</b> &#150; The site <a href="http://www.comunismo.com.br">www.comunismo.com.br</a> was not the instigator of the call for my assassination. An anonymous person posted the message there, which was taken off yesterday. The IP address of the guy has already been put at the disposition of the authorities by the manager of the site. More on that in a few days. I have already written to the webmaster of the site to thank him for his collaboration with the investigations. The site is not in itself a vehicle of communist propaganda, but of debates about communism, being open to receive anti-communist messages as well.</font></p> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2">On the other hand <b>Centro de M&iacute;dia Independente</b> reacted to my denunciations in a very suspicious way. First, they published a warning recognizing that the homicidal messages were criminal, while at same time, collaborating with the crime scandalously kept them on the air. On the following day, when my article &#147;Salto Qualitativo&#148; (Qualitative Leap) was published in <i>O Globo</i>, suddenly the site took off the air not only the appeal to commit homicide but all the messages in support of it, keeping in view only the messages in my favor, so that those who now visit the site will be surprised that I am accusing of homicidal propaganda people who speak so well of me. If there is not a catch there, there is at least some demonic confusion. <b>&#150; O. de C.</b></font></p> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b><a name="2">WARNING 2</a> (April 7th, 2003)</b> &#150; I have just received a message from Mr. &#147;Diego Rivera&#148;, who, still keeping his real name secret, says that his calling for homicide, published in the site <a href="http://www.comunismo.com.br">www.comunismo.com.br</a>, was not against me, but towards any generic target. Right afterwards, as amazing as it may seem, he declares that he limited himself to copying the content of CMI&#146;s site. Well, damn, if the aggression there was against me, how can it have changed its target merely by changing sites? This story gets weirder and weirder every day. <b>&#150; O. de C.</b></font></p> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b><a name="3">WARNING 3</a> (April 7th, 2003)</b> &#150; Today, April 7th, 2003, the murderous message, which was temporarily off the air, is back again on the CMI site, even though the site managers confess it is criminal. It is, therefore, a conscious and deliberate act of justifying a crime. CMI is not a news organization, but a militant institution of international scale, linked to anti-US movements. Its site systematically promotes anonymity of the messages, which is forbidden by the Brazilian Constitution, a document that this mob considers worthless. <b>&#150; O. de C.</b></font></p>
