<p>Brazilian President Lula da Silva's once larger-than-life reputation 
              has been reduced to tatters by a seemingly endless corruption scandal.</p>
            <p>Brazil&#8217;s President Lula da Silva is immersed in a seemingly 
              endless corruption scandal; his once larger-than-life reputation 
              has been reduced to tatters. The significance of this is not negligible: 
              Lula has become an emblem of the post-Cold War left with his combination 
              of conservative fiscal and monetary policies and big social programs 
              targeting the poor.</p>
            <p>A breathtaking sequence of revelations involving the government 
              and Lula&#8217;s Workers&#8217; Party &#8212; beginning with the 
              confession by opposition legislator Roberto Jefferson that he had 
              received bribes for his vote in Congress &#8212; has brought to 
              the surface a vast scheme of bribes to legislators and irregular 
              methods of party financing.</p>
            <p>The conventional wisdom was that, despite his radical Marxist roots 
              and occasional concessions to his political base, Lula represented 
              a healthy move away from the old left and toward the emergence of 
              a new model for underdeveloped nations similar to Europe&#8217;s 
              social democracy. Many thought this model would have a moderating 
              effect on the left across the continent and hold Hugo Ch&aacute;vez 
              in check.</p>
            <p>However, Lula&#8217;s capacity to reinvent the left always hinged 
              on something more than keeping interest rates high to stem inflation, 
              maintaining a strong currency, riding on the high prices of certain 
              commodities, and giving cash to poor families. He could either opt 
              for simply managing the perpetual crisis or he could try to overhaul 
              a labyrinthine political system that benefited certain pockets of 
              industrial and agricultural production but keeps millions of people 
              out of the realm of opportunity. He chose the former path.</p>
            <p>While technocrats talk about a three percent rate of economic growth 
              for Brazil this year and an export boom that has translated into 
              a trade &#8220;surplus&#8221; of $40 billion, Lula&#8217;s voters 
              are indignant at the corruption scandal. But the real point is that 
              corruption has developed naturally in an environment of limited 
              opportunities due to asphyxiating government interference. And the 
              absence of adequate limits on the power of the political bureaucracy 
              is in turn an incentive for corruption at the top level. The corruption 
              of Lula&#8217;s government, therefore, should be seen more as a 
              symptom than a cause. Ranting about corruption without removing 
              the causes will only generate further frustration. Brazilians impeached 
              President Collor de Mello in the 1990s but failed to change a system 
              that ensured a party like Lula&#8217;s would fall into the same 
              trap years later.</p>
            <p>Brazil has often been a bellwether of Latin American political 
              currents. It exemplified French-style authoritarian positivism in 
              the early 20th century, centrally planned industrialization in the 
              1960s and 1970s, and democracy in the 1980s. (It was not, however, 
              one of the leading nations in the so-called free market reform wave 
              of the 1990s). Lula&#8217;s demise is now strengthening the more 
              radical left, which has been quick to blame what is happening on 
              the President&#8217;s &#8220;betrayal&#8221; of his Marxist origins. 
              The rest of the Latin American left is watching.</p>
            <p>Widespread corruption in underdeveloped countries is a symptom 
              of the cost of the law and the weakness of the legal framework. 
              If laws are burdensome and costly to follow, and there is no reliable 
              system for enforcing contracts, corruption becomes a sort of insurance 
              policy. As legal scholar Richard Posner has written, &#8220;nepotism, 
              clientelism, and bribery become substitutes for contract when the 
              enforcement of contract is undependable.&#8221; Over an extended 
              period of time, corruption becomes a culture.</p>
            <p>The latest &#8220;Doing Business&#8221; report by the World Bank 
              shows that an average domestic company with fewer than 100 employees 
              in Brazil would have to pay 148 percent of its annual profits in 
              order to comply with all its taxes. A medium-sized company must 
              spend 2,600 hours just in order to pay them.</p>
            <p>It is not surprising that regulations and taxes have taken on a 
              life of their own in Brazil, where the structure of government includes 
              more than 5,500 autonomous municipalities, 10 million civil servants 
              and a multitude of supposedly decentralized but really overlapping 
              layers of bureaucracy competing for a piece of the action. Although 
              this labyrinth has one positive aspect &#8212; it makes centralized 
              decisions difficult to implement &#8212; it is totally impractical 
              for reform-minded people.</p>
            <p>Lula thought that as long as he kept macroeconomic stability and 
              continued with his &#8220;Bolsa Familia&#8221; program &#8212; a 
              conditional cash transfer that gives 50 dollars to each of 7 million 
              families in exchange for making sure their children go to school 
              &#8212; &#8220;social justice&#8221; would flow. Judging by the 
              lack of investment at all levels of the economy, most Brazilians 
              clearly did not agree. Prosperity requires a massive de-politicization 
              of the prevailing system so that entrepreneurship can flourish. 
              In the absence of that, it is not hard to see why Lula&#8217;s government 
              became so corrupt.</p>
            <p>Olavo de Carvalho, a Brazilian writer, recently remarked at a conference 
              in Washington DC that &#8220;corruption is deeply rooted in the 
              Worker&#8217;s Party not as a vulgar way for personal moneymaking 
              but as a technical instrument to erode the moral basis of the capitalistic 
              society and fund the revolutionary strategy.&#8221; How ironic that 
              the man who was to save Latin America from old-style socialism is 
              helping revive it.</p>
