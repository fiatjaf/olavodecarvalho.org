            The site which with exemplary cynicism calls itself &#147;Centro de
            M&iacute;dia Independente&#148; (Center of Independent Media) lost
            its last scruples and progressed to criminality pure and simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            CMI is a millionaire NGO, with offices in more than a hundred
            countries, hell bent on making anti-American and anti-Israeli
            propaganda, exactly on the same line of thousands of nazi and
            communist sites. Yet they have no shame in calling
            &#147;fascist&#148; those who take stands opposite to theirs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desperate at not being able to answer the denuciations I present in
            my articles and in <i>M&iacute;dia Sem M&aacute;scara</i
            ><sup><a name="1" href="#nota1">1</a></sup
            >, above all about the alliance of the so-called
            &#147;pacifists&#148; with neo-nazi movements, the site is now
            calling for the method of &#147;direct action&#148;, the same used
            by Mussolini to cut &#147;evil&#148; at its roots, by eliminating me
            physically.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not feel any inclination whatsoever to trust my safety to the
            leftist authorities that govern us, which have already proved to be
            more interested in protecting the Farcs from the US than in
            protecting the Brazilian people from the Farcs and other criminal
            organizations associated with their party in the S�o Paulo Forum,
            the strategic coordination of the communist movement on the
            continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not have therefore, the most minimal guarantees for my life or
            work. I am outside of constitutional rights and excluded from that
            &#147;citizenship&#148;.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, it is of no importance what happens to me. Dying is not a
            disease or reason for shame. Shame is living in a country where only
            murderers have the protection of the authorities. Shame is to be
            member of a professional class in which the preaching of homicide
            bears the label of &#147;fight against intolerance&#148;.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am ashamed of belonging to a people who elect as president a
            friend of the Farc, I am ashamed of having as professional
            colleagues the scoundrels from CMI.
          </p>
          <p>
            If shame killed, they would not even need the molotov cocktails they
            intend to throw at me: I would already be dead merely from reading
            what they write.

                The reknowned bookshop chain Cultura, from S&atilde;o Paulo, is
                advertising in the radical-right site &#147;M&iacute;dia Sem
                M&aacute;scara&#148;. The site adopts a totally pro-Bush and
                pro-war position and has been publishing a series of offensive
                articles and inciting hatred against Arabs and Muslims.

                it is losing clients by sponsoring an extreme-right site, which
                supports the war, intolerance and the U.S. hegemony over the

                A boycott made by us, really progressive people, who really
                fight imperialism, intolerance, and fascism, would be good, but
                unfortunately not enough.

                Indeed, if we analyse the profile of the typical customer of the
                Cultura bookshop, we will see that he/she is a member of the
                institutional high bourgeoisie. After all, the prices of the
                books in this bookshop are offensive (mainly the imported ones).

                There are around 200 volunteers all around Brazil who produce
                material in video, radio and articles and who manage the site
                (that is, it is their duty to &#147;choose&#148; or censor the
                material published at the site). These volunteers are divided
                into &#147;collectives&#148; and the largest ones are in
                S&atilde;o Paulo, Rio, and Rio Grande do Sul. The
                &#147;collectives&#148; are made of high school students,
                graduates, architects, physicists, journalists, system analysts

                According to Pablo Ortellado, in a declaration to the Union of
                Journalists of Paran&aacute;: &#147;<i
                  >Since April 21st of last year, when the FBI filed a lawsuit
                  asking for logs which would allow them to identify the 1.5
                  million hits and would end the right to privacy of our users,
                  we have decided not to register any more hits. The story of
                  why the FBI asked for the logs is long, but basically it was
                  motivated by an article which made public the security plans
                  during the protest in Quebec against the Americas Summit which
                  was to discuss FTAA. If we handed in the logs, and we had a
                  legal battle to prevent that, the American government would
                  know exactly who accessed each of our materials and what time.
                  It would be a huge attack against the freedom of the users.
                  For that reason we do not register the logs. But, during the
                  protests in Geneva in July last year, we had a problem with
                  the software and we registered the logs for some hours. Making
                  a projection with old data and what we knew in July, CMI
                  Brazil had about 3 thousand daily hits, about a thousand users
                  and during crises this access increases three or four times.
                  In the global net, there are about 600 thousand hits and 100
                  thousand users, a considerable part of which is centered in
                  the global site, which is managed by an international
                  collective. But, in times of crisis, the number can go up to a
                  million users.</i

                At the time of the terrorist attacks, Pablo Ortellado and his
                colleague, Mo&eacute;sio Rebou&ccedil;as, were the organizers of
                the first anti-American protest &#150; just 15 days after more
                than 3 thousand Americans were murdered in the Twin Towers. They
                and others took advantage of the mobilization for a protest that
                had been organized against an IMF meeting which had been
                canceled because of the attacks and changed the objective to
                &#147;peace against American militarism&#148; (right after the
                largest foreign attack against the US in history!). The text of
                the link was made by Ortellado himself and shows his vision of
                how the antiglobalization movement originated (which has now
                taken off its mask and shows its true colors: anti-Americanism
                and anti-Semitic):
