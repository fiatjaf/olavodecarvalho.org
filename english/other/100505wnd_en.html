          <div> 
            <p>I've been thinking &#8230; well, I've been reading and thinking. 
              I've been reading Erwin Lutzer's latest work, &quot;When A Nation 
              Forgets God: Seven Lessons We Must Learn From Nazi Germany.&quot; 
              Published by Moody Publishers, the Moody Church pastor analyses 
              how the church in Germany fell under the sway of Adolf Hitler. Here's 
              the bad news: &quot;By far the majority of the Lutheran churches 
              sided with Hitler and his spectacular reforms.&quot; The good news: 
              &quot;But a minority, under the leadership of Bonhoeffer and Niemoller, 
              chose to pull away from the established church to form the 'Confessing 
              Church.'&quot;</p>
            <p>I find it disturbing that the Obama administration is trying to 
              use churches, including evangelical churches, for its own political 
              purposes.</p>
            <p>The May 3, 2010, issue of The Weekly Standard carries an article 
              by Meghan Clyne entitled &quot;The Green Shepherd,&quot; describing 
              how the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships 
              is seeking to enroll gullible Christian churches in its efforts 
              to control the climate &#8211; paraded under the guise of fighting 
              poverty and injustice.</p>
            <p>One of the &quot;Green Shepherds&quot; chosen by the Obama administration 
              to deceive evangelicals is none other than the Rev. Jim Wallis!</p>
            <p>Clyne's article's subtitle summarizes the administration's underlying 
              political goal: &quot;The White House wants churches to advance 
              its climate change agenda.&quot; She points out that while Wallis 
              wrote in December 2006 that &quot;Republicans shamelessly politicized 
              the faith-based initiative,&quot; Wallis himself is now &quot;a 
              member ofObama's faith-based council and has also met with congressional 
              Democrats to help them frame their policies in more morally appealing 
              terms.&quot; These Wallis-trained Democrats will in turn make &quot;inroads 
              with religious voters.&quot; Sound similar to Hitler's making inroads 
              with the Lutherans of his day?</p>
            <p>Here is Students for a Democratic Society's Jim Wallis, defender 
              of Fidel Castro and a party to the proliferation of Communist revolutions 
              throughout Central America, moving amongst the evangelicals and 
              deceiving them left and left. Wallis has been a radical ever since 
              he graduated from Michigan State University. (If you're interested 
              in more commentary on Wallis and his Sojourners magazine, see <a href="http://www.summit.org/blogs/the-presidents-desk/barack-obamas-red-spiritual-advisor/">&quot;Barack 
              Obama's 'Red' Spiritual Advisor&quot; article</a> on Summit Ministries' 
              website.)</p>
            <p>Wallis' ability to deceive reaches high into evangelical circles. 
              For example, an article posted on the Sojourners blog entitled &quot;Beyond 
              Charity: Living a Life of Compassion and Justice&quot; written by 
              the wife of Willow Creek Pastor Bill Hybels says the following: 
              &quot;The battle against injustice is a tough and ugly war. While 
              I am proud that Willow has entered that war, the truth is we have 
              just begun to fight. &#8230; I look forward to the day when we as 
              a church will be known for being the greenest church on the planet, 
              not just because we enjoy the beauty of God's creation, but because 
              we know that climate change is a justice issue.&quot; Included in 
              her suggested reading list is Jim Wallis and his Sojourners magazine.</p>
            <p>This idea that climate change is a justice/injustice issue is 100 
              percent in synch with the President's Advisory Council on Faith-Based 
              andNeighborhood Partnerships, which &quot;envisions the 'partnership' 
              between government and religious institutions as a means of spreading 
              the administration's environmental warnings, rather than just a 
              way to help churches feed the hungry and clothe the poor.&quot; 
              No wonder Clyne closes her article with the comment, &quot;Perhaps 
              it's only reasonable that global warming activists would turn to 
              God for help as the scientific case for their position collapses.&quot;</p>
            <p>But let me be blunt and suggest that Mrs. Hybels would be better 
              informed if she would read Theodore Dalrymple's &quot;Life at the 
              Bottom,&quot; Peter Bauer's &quot;Equality, the Third World, and 
              Economic Delusion&quot; and Thomas Sowell's &quot;Intellectuals 
              and Society.&quot;</p>
            <p>In fact, if she were to read Sowell's work she would discover at 
              least one secret to lifting the poor out of poverty, which we can 
              assume is her desire in attaining &quot;social justice,&quot; since 
              she never clearly articulates what she means by the term. Writes 
              Sowell, &quot;Under new economic policies beginning in the 1990s, 
              tens of millions of people in India have risen above that country's 
              poverty level. In China, under similar policies begun earlier, a 
              million people a month have risen out of poverty.&quot;</p>
            <p>Unfortunately this is not welcomed news by the radical left because 
              these economic policies are capitalistic and hence politically incorrect. 
              Sowell quotes French writer Raymond Aron who admits that intellectuals 
              want to see prosperity only &quot;through State intervention&quot; 
              and &quot;the revolutionary code&quot; and hence are resentful over 
              such capitalistic victories. Better poor under socialism than well 
              off under capitalism seems to be their motto! </p>
