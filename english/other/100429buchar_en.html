            <p>Frontpage Interview&#8217;s guest today is Robert Buchar, an associate 
              professor and author of the Cinematography Program at Columbia College 
              in Chicago. A political refugee from former Czechoslovakia, he is 
              the producer of the documentary, Velvet Hangover, which is about 
              Czech New Wave filmmakers, how they survived the period of &#8220;normalization&#8221; 
              and their reflections on the so-called Velvet Revolution of 1989. 
              He is the author of the new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reality-Damned-Undoing-America-communism/dp/1609111664/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1271194009&sr=1-1-fkmr0">And

              Europe</a>. The book is based on a documentary feature he is currently 
              working on, <em>The Collapse of Communism: The Untold Story.</em></p>
            <p><strong>FP:</strong> Robert Buchar, welcome to Frontpage Interview.</p>
            <p>You have some quite startling things to say about the fall, or 
              lack thereof, of the Soviet Empire in the period 1989-1991. What 
              is it that we don&#8217;t know about the &#8220;collapse of communism&#8221; 
              as it has been described to us in the media?</p>
            <p>Nina Karsov recently informed us, here at Frontpage Interview, 
              of many troubling facts connected to <a href="http://frontpagemag.com/2010/04/29/2010/03/23/the-triumph-of-soviet-deception/">The 
              Triumph of Soviet Deception</a>. Please also comment on her interview 
              and give us your own angle.</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar:</strong> Thank you for the opportunity to be here.</p>
            <p>The great political upheaval of the late 20th century&#8212;the 
              fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet 
              Union&#8212;is generally regarded as the spontaneous product of 
              long-accumulating social and economic pressures. That is the official 
              story, which was hammered into our heads by the western media. If 
              you try suggesting that this is not the case, the media will not 
              take you seriously and even refuse to discuss what you are trying 
              to say. It is a taboo topic. But the ample of evidence suggests 
              otherwise.</p>
            <p>During the final phase of the Cold War, the Soviet Union, under 
              its dogmatic and visibly senile party bosses, was sinking into near-bankruptcy. 
              Yuri Andropov, Chairman of the KGB&#8212;the only organization with 
              both a full knowledge of the state of the economy and a mastery 
              of strategic decisions&#8212;came to the conclusion that there was 
              no cure for the grave illness of the communist system. To preserve 
              the wealth that threatened to slip out of the leaders&#8217; hands, 
              he masterminded a nearly unthinkable program&#8212;throwing into 
              the fire Moscow&#8217;s rule over the Eastern European bloc&#8212;and, 
              as it turned out, the ruling party of the USSR itself. Though Andropov 
              died in 1984, the signs of his hand in the events that followed 
              remain visible, as well as the role of his handpicked successor, 
              Mikhail Gorbachev. Witnesses in my book testify that what appeared 
              to be a spontaneous freedom movement in 1989 was in fact a coup 
              d&#8217;&eacute;tat orchestrated from Moscow&#8212;in the offices 
              of the Russian KGB. Americans and Europeans no longer remember the 
              past and don&#8217;t realize that history is now repeating itself.</p>
            <p>Nina Karsov, in the interview with you, rightly quoted Jozef Mackiewicz 
              referring to Western democracies as &#8220;deaf and blind men.&#8221; 
              Western democracies never understood the Soviet system as such. 
              The idea of deception as the foundation of foreign policy doesn&#8217;t 
              fit into our way of thinking. Westerners can hardly comprehend a 
              pursuit without material benefit, with strictly ideological goals 
              based on a policy of conspiracy against other states. And that is 
              what this is all about. We had quite a few predecessors of Perestoika 
              in the past. We had the economic deception in the 1920s, deception 
              of peaceful coexistence, and the &#8216;d&eacute;tente&#8217; under 
              the Brezhnev regime.</p>
            <p>Deception is an essential part of communist ideology. It is a central 
              part of communism and it will continue to be like this. As Nina 
              rightly pointed out, &#8220;it would be hard to believe that the 
              wolf has become a vegetarian.&#8221; Communism is indeed totalitarian 
              and was never interested in any compromise. So, the &#8220;end of 
              communism&#8221; proclaimed by the West is a myth. And now we can 
              see the resurgence of communism with the help of the Western right. 
              Instead of punishing the communists for their crimes, the Western 
              right has extended them a hand, like a sign of apology for defeating 
              them. <u>As Olavo de Carvalho nicely pointed out in the interview 
              with Alex Newman for The New American magazine, &#8220;This absurd 
              surrender of the winners was also stimulated by powerful globalist 
              circles, whose interest in establishing worldwide bureaucratic controls 
              converges with the objectives of communism.&#8221;</u></p>
            <p>Nina Karsov made a very important point at the end of your interview, 
              pointing out the incremental, but rapid erosion of our own liberties 
              here in the West, the increase of state powers over the individual, 
              and she raised the question of whether we are approaching the victory 
              of authoritarian and totalitarian power, under which collective 
              thinking, uniformity and conformity will dominate. I lived in that 
              system for thirty years before defecting to the United States. It 
              never crossed my mind that it will catch up with me eventually. 
              So I may say, no thank you, I have been there. I am not interested. 
              Nina is absolutely right, people don&#8217;t see the essence of 
              communism as a world mission. The majority of people in the West 
              can&#8217;t even define communism. Unfortunately, they just have 
              no idea.</p>
            <p><strong>FP:</strong> Tell us about the documents that Vladimir 
              Bukovsky acquired from the KGB archives and from the confidential 
              files of Gorbachev&#8217;s library. How come we don&#8217;t hear 
              anything about this in the media?</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar:</strong> Vladimir Bukovsky got access to some KGB 
              files in 1992 when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, being 
              banned by Yeltsin the previous year after the coup, actually protested 
              and disputed that ban in the Constitutional Court of Russia, frightening 
              Yeltsin&#8217;s entourage. Yeltsin&#8217;s adviser called Bukovsky, 
              asking him to come and help them with the court case. He agreed 
              under the condition that they open the archives. So he had open 
              access to secret archives during that time. He managed to scan thousands 
              of pages into his laptop computer for half a year. That was the 
              initial bunch of documents that he got out. Based on these documents, 
              he published the book &#8220;Judgment in Moscow.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Then, years later, a son of his friend in Moscow, Pavel Stroilov, 
              became a student and without really realizing that there are copies 
              of lots of documents, secret documents of the Politburo in the possession 
              of the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow, he found them through the 
              Internet by chance. What apparently happened in the turmoil of 1991 
              when the Soviet Union ceased to exist and Gorbachev was ousted from 
              power, was that he actually took the trouble of making copies of 
              almost all the files and secret documents concerning his period 
              of power, from 1985 to 1991.</p>
            <p>Bukovsky instructed Pavel to go to the Gorbachev Foundation, pretending 
              that he was writing a paper for his University course and asking 
              permission to work in the archive. Permission was granted and he 
              was allowed to look at some parts of the archives. Being a bright 
              young man with a good knowledge of computers, he actually broke 
              the administration&#8217;s password and copied the entire computer. 
              He was sending this stuff for almost a year in small portions to 
              Vladimir in England every day. Finally, when he copied everything, 
              he came to England. The most remarkable thing is that, two weeks 
              after he finished copying the presidential administration files, 
              the Putin administration learned that Gorbachev had made these documents 
              accessible and explicitly ordered him to block all public access 
              to these documents because they were originals and were still secret 
              in the archives of the Politburo. So suddenly, right after Stroilov 
              finished copying all these documents, access was closed completely. 
              He was very lucky. Anyway, Bukovsky suddenly had 700,000 pages. 
              He acquired transcripts of all the talks Gorbachev had with local 
              leaders, foreign leaders, and public figures. He had all the reports 
              by his aids, memos, the ministry of Politburo meetings, and so on 
              and so forth. This was a huge amount of material. He admitted that 
              digging into these files is an endless process.</p>
            <p>Why don&#8217;t we hear anything about it? Well, we would have 
              to ask Bukovsky and Stroilov first. I can see two major reasons. 
              First of all, the files are in Russian and not too many people in 
              the West can read them. All that stuff has to be translated first. 
              Secondly, who cares? The media are not interested in bringing up 
              the true picture of what happened and how it happened, politicians 
              don&#8217;t want to hear it because it is an inconvenient true, 
              and there are powerful forces who will probably try to stop any 
              attempt to do so.</p>
            <p>Not too many people in America realized that <em>Judgment in Moscow</em> 
              was never published in English. The publisher caved in under the 
              KGB pressure. When I met Vladimir last May in Prague, he told me 
              he has a new book about the re-unification of Germany, what and 
              how it really happened, but he can&#8217;t find a publisher. And 
              from my personal experience, during the last seven years, I wasn&#8217;t 
              able to raise a dime for my documentary and from the media I received 
              a surprisingly uniform reply: the topic doesn&#8217;t fit our programming 
              profile. Since my book was published last November in the Czech 
              Republic under the title <em>REVOLUCE 1989</em>, no media there 
              dared to mention it, nobody wrote a review. You figure out.</p>
            <p><strong>FP:</strong> Give us some information about the Soviets&#8217; 
              involvement in international terrorism. And I also obviously include 
              the current Putin regime. As Pavel Stroilov explained in <a href="http://97.74.65.51/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=29472">an 
              interview</a> with me awhile back, the FSB is still up to no good 
              in that department, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar: </strong>Pavel Stroilov is absolutely right. But 
              I am afraid that there are not too many people in the West willing 
              to listen, accept, or publish what he is saying. What he is saying 
              is so politically incorrect. There has been that interesting phenomenon 
              for a long time of the CIA systematically fogging the issue of the 
              Soviets&#8217; and subsequently Russians&#8217; involvement in the 
              international terrorism. Bill Gertz calls it the anti-anti-communist 
              mindset.</p>
            <p>The objective of the Soviet regime was always to overthrow the 
              United States as the world&#8217;s leading power. The KGB fathered 
              state sponsored terrorism and invented international terrorism in 
              the 1960&#8217;s. Even the PLO was dreamt up by the KGB. Global 
              terrorism as we know it was conceived at the Lubyanka. As Yuri Andropov 
              once explained to Ion Pacepa, the Muslim world was a Petri dish 
              in which the Russians might &#8220;nurture a virulent strain of 
              American hatred grown from the bacterium of Marxist-Leninist thought.&#8221;</p>
            <p>There are plenty of documents proving the Russians&#8217; involvement 
              in international terrorism. They show how they supplied, trained, 
              created, and governed almost every terrorist organization on earth. 
              Vladimir Bukovsky has these documents. Starting with the Palestinians, 
              the Red Brigades in Italy, Baider-Meinhof in Germany, Action Direct 
              in France, ETA in Spain, IRA in Ireland and so on. They were all 
              clients of the Soviet Union, not to mention states like Iraq, Libya, 
              and Syria, which were terrorist states by definition who were under 
              Soviet influence and were supplied by the Soviets. Many of these 
              documents are available on line. People are not aware that the KGB 
              after the end of the WW2 focused heavily on taking over the Abwehr 
              intelligence network in Arabic countries.</p>
            <p>It is interesting that the CIA in the 1970&#8217;s was still denying 
              the Soviets&#8217; involvement in international terrorism. It wasn&#8217;t 
              till a small group of DIA people started debriefing Czech defector 
              Gen.Jan Sejna around 1976 that the denial had no ground to stand 
              on. By the way, Jan Sejna was never debriefed by the CIA. This is 
              when the Soviet sponsorship of international terrorism was first 
              laid out in detail. These analysts recognized that they couldn&#8217;t 
              come out with this information as it was, because it would be immediately 
              attacked by the CIA.</p>
            <p>As Joseph Douglass explains in my book: &#8220;What they did was 
              give the CIA the list of documents.&#8221; In the next meeting, 
              the head of this group proceeded to discredit every single CIA source 
              and document in an effort to kill the Defense Intelligence study. 
              Finally, one of the analysts stood up and looked at the representative 
              from the National Security Agency and said, &#8220;Are you going 
              to discredit your sources too?&#8221; And the NSA guy looked back 
              and he said, &#8220;Absolutely not. We stand by every one of those 
              sources.&#8221; As a result of that, the idea of Soviet involvement 
              in international terrorism finally started to surface. However, 
              there was still a large effort to discredit it by the CIA people 
              who controlled the NIE process and also through the various leakages 
              to the media, which were intended to discount stories saying that 
              the Soviet Union was a focus of international terrorism.</p>
            <p>Today when the CIA talks about terrorism, they simply mean violence 
              by someone we don&#8217;t like. In other words, they cannot distinguish 
              between innocent and guilty. We cannot distinguish between good 
              and evil.</p>
            <p><strong>FP: </strong>Why has the CIA and the American government 
              for so long resisted acknowledging this reality? Indeed, while all 
              western intelligence agencies agree that KGB/FSB/SVR activities 
              are at the highest level ever, the CIA and the U.S. government don&#8217;t 
              do anything about it and play down the danger and consequences of 
              Russian support of terror.</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar:</strong> As Oleg Gordievsky told me, there are 
              over 400 Russian spies operating in the US and our government does 
              nothing about it. The CIA itself has always had a very strong, let&#8217;s 
              say pro-socialist, pro-communist component. The actual extent of 
              this has never been revealed till a number of intercepts known as 
              the Venona intercepts started to be released as early as the 1990s. 
              Among other things, they show that within U.S. intelligence, going 
              back to the beginning of WORLD WAR II, there were at least 100 communist 
              that they were aware of, of which some 40 percent were known Soviet 
              agents that were not tracked down and exposed. This provides a very 
              questionable background on certain components of our intelligence 
              services and may help to explain a number of things. It also might 
              explain why, and in an outlandish matter, they almost went out of 
              their way to treat defectors as undesirable people and do everything 
              they could in their power to stop them from talking rather than 
              gaining information from them.</p>
            <p>This was such a serious problem that it actually led to Congressional 
              hearings in the mid-1970s. It got no publicity to speak of. It also 
              perhaps helps to explain why it is that the CIA did their best to 
              kill the idea that there was Soviet sponsorship of international 
              terrorism back in the 1970s which continued until the ridiculous 
              nature of their efforts was exposed in 1981 by a number of books 
              and documents that came out and showed how the Soviet Union was 
              indeed the primary sponsor of international terrorism. They were 
              the only sponsor, really.</p>
            <p>When Yuri Andropov, the KGB Chairman, ordered the assasination 
              of the Pope, it triggered a debate within the CIA between the political 
              appointees and the career intelligence analysts who argued over 
              a benign, leftist view of the world and especially of the Soviet 
              Union. They argued bitterly within the secret councils of the CIA 
              over whether or not the Soviet Union was really behind terrorism. 
              Again, to say the Soviets weren&#8217;t behind terrorism was kind 
              of a na&iuml;ve mindset. It was totally incorrect. They didn&#8217;t 
              really understand that the Soviet Union was sponsoring international 
              terrorism and that it was doing so as part of a strategy to undermine 
              the United States and other Western governments. This was a kind 
              of classic example of how liberal and leftist bureaucrats within 
              the CIA and the intelligence community caused serious damage to 
              the United States.</p>
            <p><strong>FP:</strong> Remind us a bit about what we learned from 
              defectors like Anatoliy Golitsyn, Jan Sejna, Ion Pacepa, Vasili 
              Mitrokhin, and most recently Sergei Tretyakov.</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar: </strong>When Anatoliy Golitsyn defected in 1961he 
              brought a lot of valuable information about KGB penetrations that 
              made many Western governments embarrassed. However, the most important 
              information he brought, in his mind, was the revelation that the 
              Soviet Union was involved in a massive deception and they had the 
              means of succeeding in this deception, that they had established 
              feedback within the American intelligence community and that they 
              could monitor what was happening, and that they had put agents in 
              place and were spreading disinformation.</p>
            <p>That was something nobody was able or wiling to comprehend and 
              he was quickly labelled as an unreliable conspiracy theorist. In 
              addition to that he insisted that the CIA was penetrated by the 
              KGB and that this created conflict within the U.S. intelligence 
              bureaucracy. We should add that the Soviets spent a lot of energy 
              on discrediting Golitsyn in the media and in 1962 approved a plan 
              for his assasination. To make a long story short, in his book titled 
              <em>New Lies for Old</em> in 1984, Golitsyn included 148 predictions 
              about the &#8220;collapse of communism in Europe.&#8220; According 
              to researcher Mark Riebling &#8220;139 out of 148&#8221; of Golitsyn&#8217;s 
              predictions &#8220;were fulfilled by the end of 1993. When Golitsyn 
              slowly faded out of the spotlight in 1968, a new defector, Gen. 
              Jan Sejna, emerged, repeating pretty much the same thing. The CIA 
              didn&#8217;t bother to debrief him. In his 1982 book <em>We Will 
              Burry You</em>, he wrote &#8220;One of the basic problems of the 
              West is its frequent failure to recognize the existence of any Soviet 
              &#8216;grand design&#8217; at all.&#8221; And no surprise, the Czech 
              BIS till today is still obsessed with Sejna, devoting an enormous 
              space on its website to discredit him as a liar and crook.</p>
            <p>Vasili Mitrokhin defected to Great Britain in 1992. Documents he 
              brought with him helped complete the picture of the Soviets&#8217; 
              deception and KGB operations all around the world. It clearly revealed 
              that the KGB saw the third world countries as the key to winning 
              the Cold War. It should be pointed out that Mitrokhin offered his 
              files to Americans first and they turned him down. Then he went 
              to the British, who arranged his defection and transportation of 
              documents from Russia. One former high-ranking CIA official told 
              me how embarrassing it was to beg British later to see the documents. 
              The so called &#8220;Mitrokhin&#8217;s files&#8221; also shows that 
              KGB influence on Soviet foreign policy has been greatly underrated 
              in the West and most of the advances in the Soviet military was 
              achieved by covert acquisition of Western technology.</p>
            <p>The most recent defector, Sergei Tretyakov, who defected in 2000, 
              in the book <em>Comrade J</em>, is warning us: &#8220;I want to 
              warn Americans. As people, you are very na&iuml;ve about Russia 
              and its intentions. You believe because the Soviet Union no longer 
              exists, Russia now is your friend. It isn&#8217;t, and I can show 
              you how the SVR is trying to destroy the US even today and even 
              more than the KGB did during the Cold War.&#8221;</p>
            <p><strong>FP:</strong> How come our government still doesn&#8217;t 
              get it? Is it sort of a strategy of intentional blindness or just 
              plain blindness? Or is there something else in play we don&#8217;t 
              know?</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar:</strong> Obviously there is a lot of we don&#8217;t 
              know and probably we will never know. We can only look at facts 
              available and come up with our own conclusions. It is obvious that 
              international finance is pushing hard for the New World Order, a 
              sort of global management, perhaps as Zbigniew Brzezinski talks 
              about. In his book <em>The Grand Chessboard</em> he suggests that 
              the United States, in the near future, must cease to be the superpower 
              and that this will lead to the creation of a new global system of 
              government where politics will be replaced by new global management. 
              <u>Let me quote, for lack of better words, Olavo de Carvalho here 
              again: &#8220;What we have is a gigantic symbiosis of all globalist 
              and statist forces around the world. Meta-capitalists are natural 
              allies of the communists.&#8221;</u> The communist movement evolved, 
              perfected to deal with dissidences, using them as instruments to 
              adapt to local situations. It can&#8217;t get any more scary, I 
              guess. As far as our politicians go, yes, I think we can call it 
              the political blindness from which no meaningful strategy can arise. 
              Unless, of course, their strategy really is global management. I 
              am glad I am so old.</p>
            <p><strong>FP:</strong> What would be the consequences of admitting 
              that the &#8220;collapse of communism&#8221; in Europe was part 
              of a KGB plan to expand its global influence? Or is the public by 
              now &#8220;massaged&#8221; enough not to care after all?</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar:</strong> The Western public is well massaged by 
              media and &#8220;proper&#8221; education to the point they can&#8217;t 
              comprehend what is going on and in a large part they don&#8217;t 
              care anyway. The young generation of Americans today has no knowledge 
              of history and can&#8217;t put in the perspective what is going 
              on today because they have no idea what happened in the past. The 
              people living in the former Soviet Block countries have a different 
              experience, but experiencing the situation from &#8220;inside&#8221; 
              makes them unable to see the big picture. A few individuals who 
              are aware of what is going on and are concerned about it can&#8217;t 
              avert the trend. And after all, their governments don&#8217;t even 
              care what they think and say anymore. The new system was set up 
              the way that nobody can change anything. Elections can be easily 
              manipulated and the outcomes will be always the same no matter what 
              party wins. It&#8217;s hard to imagine what will be the consequences 
              of revealing what really happen back in 1980&#8217;s. I believe 
              it can never be officially accepted. Not in my lifetime.</p>
            <p><strong>FP:</strong> With Obama in power, do you think we are inevitably 
              heading toward socialism in the USA? What are the chances, in your 
              view, in terms of how things are going, that socialism may finally 
              rule the world? If yes, who can legitimately claim credit for it?</p>
            <p><strong>Buchar: </strong>You know, as serious as it is, from my 
              perspective, it&#8217;s almost funny. I feel like experiencing an 
              amazing d&eacute;j&agrave;vu. It started with the Clinton administration 
              and now it&#8217;s picking up the speed. Many things I see happening 
              I remember from my previous life in communist Czechoslovakia. In 
              politics, academia, media&#8230; it looks to me like the current 
              government is following the old textbook written in Moscow in the 
              last century when the Soviets were taking over the Eastern Europe. 
              But, of course, people here don&#8217;t know anything about it. 
              Politicians and the media perfected the process of indoctrination. 
              Deception got very sophisticated. Masses without any knowledge of 
              history in today &#8220;now-culture&#8221; can be manipulated on 
              a daily basis. A recent Rasmussen poll asked a simple question, 
              &#8220;Which is a better system&#8212;capitalism or socialism?&#8221; 
              Only 53% of American adults said capitalism. Even the same question 
              was asked young adults under 30, 37% prefer capitalism, 33% socialism, 
              and 30% are undecided.</p>
            <p>Obviously, the scale is tipping off. Decades of intensive Soviet 
              deception are finally paying off. We have a young generation now 
              without any idealism and values. In this conformist society, people 
              just follow the orders. It&#8217;s all about manipulation. The direct 
              control is not efficient anymore; influence instead is a much better 
              tool.</p>
            <p>On March 2, 2010, The Moscow Times published the article <em>Russian 
              Mafia Abroad Now 300,000 Strong</em>. It is now estimated that so-called 
              Russian Mafia controls 95% of organized crime globally. That includes 
              drug trafficking, money laundering, black market, and so on. At 
              the end, the article points out that Moscow has nothing to do with 
              it, because most of these people have no Russian passports anymore, 
              being citizens of other countries. What a convenient conclusion. 
              Oleg Gordievsky means otherwise:</p>
            <p>&#8220;The KGB started to control different business organizations 
              where the Mafia was strong. Gradually they began replacing the Mafia. 
              So, in a way, today it&#8217;s less organized crime and more KGB, 
              which is now called the FSB. Around the whole world, especially 
              in countries like Austria, Spain, and Hungary, there are a lot of 
              organizations and activities that look like the Mafia. But practically 
              all of it is run by the KGB/FSB.&#8221;</p>
            <p>And Joe Douglass adds:</p>
            <p>&#8220;There is a massive amount of money out there. It&#8217;s 
              perfectly adequate to achieve all the corruption at high political 
              levels, the highest, and to influence all the elections you want 
              around the world with absolutely no trouble at all. And not only 
              this, but the amount of money is so large that you really don&#8217;t 
              care what the precise figures are because it doesn&#8217;t really 
              matter.&#8221;</p>
            <p>People in America believe that the idea of global socialism is 
              dead. But it is not. If you look at its development in Europe and 
              Latin America, you see that there is now more socialism than ever 
              before. Because of public opinion, or rather, the media, political 
              parties, political movements, parliaments, and institutions are 
              all becoming more and more socialist. And now in the United States 
              we are really picking up speed in that direction. Back in communist 
              Czechoslovakia we used to have a saying &#8220;Socialism is a long 
              and rocky road to capitalism.&#8221; I think soon we may reverse 
              this saying &#8220;Capitalism is a long and rocky road to socialism.&#8221;</p>
            <p>As a sceptic, I would say, yes we are heading toward socialism 
              in America and there is no power to turn the ship around. But at 
              the bottom of my heart I believe there is something special about 
              the American people that common sense will prevail at the end and 
              America will survive. But who knows. A regime predicated on economic 
              optimism cannot accept the negative implications of ongoing Russian 
              enmity. No effective counter-strategy is likely to emerge from Washington.</p>
