            <p>To explain a fact by a supernatural cause [is to presuppose] that 
              there are facts with non-supernatural causes, but since God, theologically 
              speaking, is the ultimate or first cause of everything that happens, 
              then that is a merely tautological statement; to say that something 
              happened because God wanted it to happen is to imply that other 
              things may happen without God wanting them to, which is contradictory 
              to the definition of God as omnipotent and as first cause. So I 
              cannot understand how it is that a scientific investigation can 
              be carried out upon such erroneous logical foundations by both those 
              who accept the existence of the miraculous and those who do not.
            <p>Now, why do these difficulties that I have just presented seldom 
              or never appear to those discussing the subject? Because of the 
              following reason: When one intends to investigate whether a fact 
              is miraculous or not, what one usually does in the first place is 
              to assign that fact to a class of similar facts whose origins are 
              regarded as non-miraculous. Take, for instance, a man who has been 
              cured of cancer. From the outset this fact is thus considered: &quot;Here 
              is Mr. John Doe, who is said to have been miraculously cured of 
              cancer. There are, however, several people who have been non-miraculously 
              cured of cancer.&quot; You first fit that particular fact into the 
              general class called &quot;cure of cancer&quot; and then proceed 
              to investigate whether that cure in particular had supernatural 
              origins or not. With that the miraculous fact is already predefined 
              as non-miraculous, for it has already been placed under a class 
              of similar phenomena which can be otherwise explained. If, having 
              done so, you look for a miraculous cause for that fact, that is 
              tantamount to looking for something where you have already established 
              that it cannot be.</p>
            <p>So besides the methodological impediment, namely, the fact that 
              the currently practiced natural sciences can only operate within 
              boundaries defined by these sciences themselves and within which 
              only what is mensurable&#8212;therefore &quot;material&quot;&#8212;can 
              be observed besides this methodological difficulty, as I say, there 
              is an intrinsic logical difficulty: the fact is being assigned to 
              a species that by definition has been excluded from this sort of 
              investigation. This, of course, will enormously hinder the progress 
              of the investigation. This means that, if miraculous cures are regarded 
              as though they were a subset of the set of cures which is not defined 
              by the intervention of some miraculous element then the miraculous 
              fact, under this aspect, is as banal a fact as any other with the 
              difference that there might or might not also be the intervention 
              of a miraculous element in it. The miracle, in this case, is severed 
              from the very features that make it different from the other facts. 
              Under this aspect, the only difference between a miraculous and 
              a non-miraculous fact would be a cause, i.e., the difference would 
              be in the cause, not in the phenomenon itself.</p>
            <p>But if a phenomenon belongs to the same order of other phenomena, 
              it is almost impossible for us to identify in it some cause that 
              is different from that which has been indicated for all the other 
              phenomena of the same species. In other words, this sort of discussion 
              generally occurs in an atmosphere of almost psychotic mental confusion. 
              So what we would have to do, I mean, the most logical (or less infamous) 
              way of investigating the phenomenon working on the assumption that 
              we have received no direct revelation that clarifies it, working 
              on the premise that we can investigate it solely with our natural 
              lights, i.e., with the aid [of] the Holy Spirit but with no special 
              revelation, what we would have to do, I say, is in the first place 
              to see what it is that we are investigating; we have to try to delimit 
              the miraculous phenomenon by its own characteristics and independently 
              of its causes, for the causes would already be an explanation of 
              the phenomenon, and how could we find an explanation for what we 
              do not even know?</p>
            <p>The whole investigation of the miraculous has consisted exactly 
              in investigating the causes of that which we do not know and which 
              we have defined beforehand by the presence of these same causes. 
              So, if we examine, albeit superficially, a single phenomenon acknowledged 
              by the Catholic Church we have to delimit the territory in order 
              to avoid additional difficulties, for there are, of course, innumerable 
              miracles that the Church has not acknowledged as such or has not 
              even got to know, if we take, I say, only those which are acknowledged 
              by the Church as miraculous, we will observe in them some characteristics 
              that distinguish them from any other facts, leaving aside the hypothesis 
              of a supernatural cause. In other words, we do not need to investigate 
              causes at all; either the phenomenon has a distinctive element in 
              itself, independently of any consideration of its causes, or else 
              there is not even a reason to investigate the miraculous phenomenon, 
              since, in this case, it would not be distinct from any other non-miraculous 
              fact.</p>
            <p>If there exists a reason to investigate miraculous facts, it is 
              because there is in them some trait that already distinguishes them, 
              independently of whether we know their causes or not. For instance, 
              let us take the most unquestionable miracle of late, the miracle 
              of Fatima, which I myself have studied very superficially. The first 
              thing that we will notice is that this miracle is not composed of 
              a single fact. It is not an atomistic fact like the case of a man 
              who was ill and all of the sudden woke up cured, this would be regarded 
              as an atomistic, isolated fact, one that could be considered in 
              itself. What happened in Fatima was not an event, but rather a sequence 
              of interconnected events pertaining to many different species and 
              levels of reality. Firstly, the fact that three children had at 
              the same time exactly the same vision of Our Lady, and upon the 
              dates appointed, i.e., Our Lady fixed the dates when she would appear 
              before the three, who went and saw her there. Secondly, the fact 
              that they saw and heard, I mean, one of them saw, the other two 
              heard exactly the same thing, i.e., the words were exactly the same. 
              Thirdly, that vision contained a series of prophecies, i.e., predictions 
              of things that would come to pass, marked by determinate signs, 
              within a determinate period. For instance, the outbreak of a war 
              on a world scale. [In other words], if we are to make a serious 
              investigation concerning the phenomenon of miracles, we first have 
              to ascertain whether there is in them, some distinctive trait that 
              allows us to group them under a specific class without our appealing 
              to the hypothesis of their causes. Here, as in every science, the 
              definition of a phenomenon must be prior to the investigation of 
              its causes. If we do not know the what, much less can we know the 
              why.</p>
            <p>It is preposterous to include causes in the definition of any phenomenon 
              whatsoever. So what we would have to do, in the first place, is 
              a kind of phenomenology of the miraculous fact, by which we found, 
              in a purely descriptive way, its distinctive characteristics, those 
              features which allowed us to differentiate between this and other 
              orders of facts. If we never found those characteristics, then it 
              would be impossible for us to isolate a group of supposedly miraculous 
              phenomena and to investigate their causes. If miraculous phenomena 
              are already placed beforehand in the order of non-miraculous phenomena, 
              it is pointless to search for a miraculous cause for them. Moreover, 
              if you predefine them rather by some cause than by characteristics 
              of their own, then that which you wanted to investigate &#8212; 
              the presence or absence of a miraculous cause &#8212; is already 
              presupposed in the definition itself. This whole discussion is therefore 
              logical mistake upon logical mistake.</p>
            <p>We have to investigate whether the order of phenomena held as miraculous 
              has distinctive traits that we can grasp rather descriptively than 
              explanatorily. Thus isolating this set of phenomena from all others, 
              they would become perfectly distinct. Once they have been distinguished, 
              only then could we investigate their causes. In the necessarily 
              superficial approach we have to adopt in this lecture, I would suggest 
              that we examine one specific fact that is acknowledged by the Church 
              as pertaining to the miraculous order. Millions of miracles take 
              place, of course, that are not recognized by the Church or that 
              the Church does not even get to know. But to avoid greater methodological 
              difficulties, we should study only those which are accepted by the 
              Church as facts of the miraculous order. Among them, the most remarkable 
              one is evidently the miracle of Fatima.</p>
            <p> The first thing you will notice in the miracle of Fatima is that 
              it is not a single, isolated, atomistic event, something that happens 
              at a place at a certain moment. It is a sequence, almost a system, 
              of facts that appears in such an interconnected and inseparable 
              way that if you rule out one single of its elements, the whole story 
              becomes meaningless at once. That phenomenon starts to happen when 
              three children have a vision of the Virgin Mary, who sets up a series 
              of meetings with them, comes back on the appointed dates, and imparts 
              exactly the same message to them. The message contains some prophecies, 
              with the approximate dates of what is to happen, along with the 
              signs that will allow one to identify those facts just before they 
              happen. There was announced, among other facts, a world war&#8212;the 
              Second World War&#8212;which, said the Virgin Mary, the appearance 
              of a strange light in the sky would portend, which indeed happened; 
              shortly before the outbreak of World War II, there occurred over 
              continental Europe a phenomenon like the aurora borealis, usually 
              seen only further north&#8212;and soon afterwards the war broke 
              out.</p>
            <p>Another phenomenon was the Communist Revolution in Russia. Another 
              and even more recent one was the general apostasy among Christians, 
              i.e., the dispersion of Christians, the creeping of an element of 
              treason into the highest ranks of the Church&#8212;it all happened. 
              Furthermore, on the date fixed by Our Lady, there was an extraordinary 
              astronomical event that was called the &quot;dance of the sun&quot;; 
              the sun moved in the sky before thousands of witnesses, and at the 
              same time there was an outburst of miraculous cures among the sick 
              who were there and in the surroundings. Besides, the dance of the 
              sun was seen not only by those who were present at that place but 
              also by others who were many miles away and did not know that a 
              meeting between the children, the multitude, and Our Lady was taking 
              place at that moment.</p>
            <p>Now, it is this set of events that is called the miracle of Fatima. 
              It is not this thing or that thing. Any of those elements, it isolated, 
              could be catalogued under a particular science and studied by its 
              methods, but the whole set is inaccessible to the sum total of the 
              sciences. Why? Because this set is what I have called a concrete 
              fact&#8212;in truth, it is rather a concrete succession of facts. 
              The succession is concrete in the sense that all facts evolve together, 
              one fact leading to another and vice versa; the one is announced 
              beforehand, the other bears in itself the seed of the next, which, 
              in its turn, elucidates the first retroactively. Then I ask: Is 
              there any science capable of investigating the relations between 
              an astronomical phenomenon like the dance of the sun, the miraculous 
              cures, the causes of World War II, the causes of the Russian Revolution, 
              the phenomenon of those lights that appeared in the sky just before 
              the war, and three children's ability (or inability) of having a 
              vision of Our Lady? Is there any science capable of studying that? 
              Of course not.</p>
            <p> This phenomenon is inaccessible to the methods of any science 
              whatsoever. And that is what makes it miraculous. We need not appeal 
              to some &quot;supernatural cause&quot; explanation, we have not 
              the least idea of what caused all this, and we need not have it; 
              the phenomenon is miraculous in itself. Because of its own structure 
              and internal constitution, it eludes the possibility of being apprehended 
              explanatorily by the human means of knowledge. We are not even capable 
              of conceiving of a science that connects explanatorily all those 
              orders of phenomena at the same time. It simply checks human intelligence. 
              A super-science? Some sort of thing that would blend astronomy, 
              astrology, history, pathology, physiology&#8212;all these together? 
              In order to explain the miracle of Fatima, we would need a science 
              that is capable not of penetrating the facts that pertain to each 
              of the sciences (facts abstractedly selected in accordance with 
              their essential characteristics) but rather of penetrating the concrete 
              fact.</p>
            <p>Now, some lectures ago, we saw that there is no science of concrete 
              facts, and that there cannot be. Not even of one concrete fact. 
              Take a simple fact: a guy, for instance, who killed another just 
              around the corner. You can decompose this phenomenon into various 
              aspects, you can have various sciences that study these aspects 
              separatively, but there is no science that joins them all, no science 
              that can join them. You can, of course, unite those various pieces 
              of knowledge in a technology: the police technique. But when I say 
              to join, I mean it in the scientific sense: to find a common explanatory 
              principle for all those aspects of the phenomena. There can be no 
              such thing. There are no principles common to an astronomical phenomenon 
              and the causes of a war. Even if it is assumed that you believe 
              in astrology, astrologers, who have been studying this for millennia, 
              are able to sometimes indicate coincidences between an astronomical 
              and a terrestrial historical fact. A coincidence only, for which 
              they have no explanation at all. But if you do not believe in astrology, 
              things are even worse, for then you will lack the coincidence too.</p>
            <p>In the instance in a previous lecture I defined concrete fact as 
              a fact considered in the successive and simultaneous convergence 
              of all accidents that are necessary for it to be produced, for if 
              a single accident is missing, the fact is not produced. For instance, 
              the guy who killed another must have had some motive to do it&#8212;he 
              killed to rob him, or out of passion, say, jealousy, or out of some 
              interest, or out of revenge&#8212;some motive that can be traced 
              in their history and, let us say, described psychologically. Besides, 
              the offender must have used some instrument.</p>
            <p>Let us assume, for instance, that he shot the victim in the head, 
              in which case the projectile traveled along a certain trajectory 
              from the gun that was fired and struck the fellow's head with a 
              certain force. Both the trajectory and the impact are determined 
              by certain physical laws. Is there any explanatory principle that 
              is common to the motive of the crime and the trajectory of the projectile? 
              No, there is not. There is only the convergence of two absolutely 
              independent causal lines. Scientifically considered, these causes 
              are independent and are, for this very reason, studied by different 
              sciences. But in the order of the concrete fact, they are not independent, 
              for it is precisely their convergence that determines the fact; 
              if there had happened to be the one without the other, the crime 
              would not have happened. Even if there was a motive for the crime 
              and we know it perfectly well &#8212; we have investigated the criminal's 
              history, he has confessed the crime &#8212; even if we know it perfectly 
              well, as I say, but the flight path was another one &#8212; the 
              bullet hit the wall and the victim remained alive &#8212; still 
              we have no means of connecting, in the causal sphere, the new trajectory 
              of the bullet to the motive of the crime. In the field of the currently 
              existing sciences, the motive of the crime and the trajectory of 
              the bullet are not connectible rationally, only accidentally. Is 
              there a science of accidentality? By nature, by definition, there 
              is not.</p>
            <p> Now, the miraculous phenomenon, as, for that matter, any non-miraculous 
              phenomenon, is always a concrete fact, and the concrete fact is 
              composed precisely of a multitude of accidents that as such have 
              no logical connection with one another. They have a factual, an 
              accidental, so to speak, connection, and there is no science of 
              the accidental connections between thousands of independent causal 
              lines. Now, the miraculous phenomenon is distinguished from other 
              phenomena precisely by this kind of confluence of several causal 
              lines, and not by the presence of some cause in particular. The 
              miraculous phenomenon happens precisely in such a way that those 
              accidental connections are, so to speak, already presented to view 
              in the central fact itself of the miraculous set. Who connected 
              those various orders of phenomena? Who connected the dance of the 
              sun with the outbreak of World War II and of the Russian Revolution 
              and with the miraculous cures? Our Lady herself did. She said that 
              this would happen and she was making it happen.</p>
            <p>In other words, the connections between the several lines present 
              of accidentality and causality are already clarified, laid open 
              to view, in the phenomenon itself. The miraculous phenomenon, somehow, 
              has a transparency that the ordinary phenomenon does not have. It 
              is as if something of the very structure of reality exhibited itself 
              in it in a simultaneous manner, something that cannot appear in 
              the phenomena of everyday life, let alone in the phenomena investigated 
              by what are called sciences. The fact in whose very structure we 
              cannot identify the clarity of this connection &#8212; in its very 
              structure, i.e., without taking causes into account &#8212; this 
              fact, as I say, has to be excluded from the miraculous order. . 
              . .</p>
            <p>What, in their turn, do the sciences do? Having certain observed 
              facts as their point of departure, they search out a rational explanation, 
              description, or articulation for them. What is it then to study 
              scientifically an observed fact? It is to frame a real fact within 
              the order, or structure, of possibility. That is to say, the existence 
              of the structure of possibility is a presupposition of scientific 
              activity itself. The structure of possibility, however, is independent 
              of the existence of any real fact. The laws of elementary logic 
              as well as the laws of elementary arithmetic are independent of 
              even the existence of the cosmos. The fact that one plus one is 
              two is independent of the existence of the whole universe; in any 
              possible universe one plus one would necessarily have to be two. 
              The structure of logic and elementary arithmetic are the structure 
              of universal possibility. The universal possibility is exactly what, 
              theologically, is divine omnipotence.</p>
            <p> We know that in reality, in the actually existing cosmos, not 
              every possibility, not all that is possible, is actualized. We know, 
              too, that all that happens, all that is actualized, is possible. 
              So what does science do? To give a logical explanation for a fact 
              is to frame this fact within the order of possibility, within the 
              structure of possibility. Facts, i.e., the world of pure experience, 
              the empirical world, is in itself opaque. It is only made rationally 
              intelligible when framed within the possibility. When you connect 
              two things by saying that the one was caused by the other, you connect 
              the factual order to the causal order. And what is the causal order? 
              It is the structure of possibility.</p>
            <p>Now, the structure of universal possibility is independent of and 
              prior to any event whatsoever. It is, so to speak, eternal. This 
              means that if the structure of possibility did not exist, no scientific 
              study of anything whatsoever would ever be possible. We would be 
              more or less like animals capable of receiving facts but not of 
              grasping their logical connections. Animals may well grasp atomistic 
              logical connections, but, unlike us, they cannot have a system, 
              a structure of rational explanation. This structure is nothing but 
              the very order of possibility, considered not in its totality &#8212; 
              which for us is impossible &#8212; but rather within certain boundaries 
              that are accessible to us.</p>
            <p>Now, when we fit facts that are regarded as miraculous into an 
              order of non-miraculous facts and say that the former are distinguished 
              from the latter solely by the inference of some cause this means 
              that a different cause would have brought about the selfsame thing. 
              Take, for instance, two people who have been cured of cancer: the 
              one by known biochemical means; the other by a miracle. In the one 
              case, the intervening factor would have been medicine; in the other, 
              it would have been God. In other words, both the natural and the 
              supernatural cause would have brought about exactly the same thing. 
              In the first place, however, we would have to explain how it is 
              that specifically different causes can bring about exactly the same 
              thing &#8212; this kind of study is absolutely infeasible.</p>
            <p>That is why I say we would have to begin with a phenomenology of 
              the miraculous fact; the miraculous fact, then, would have to be 
              differentiated from all other facts by its visible structure itself, 
              independently of any consideration of its causes. Now, when will 
              we find a scientific explanation of the cause of the miraculous 
              phenomenon? Never, never, never, never, never. Not because of some 
              limitation of our knowledge, but because of the very structure of 
              the miraculous fact and because of the structure of what we call 
              science. . . .</p>
            <p>If there is no science of the concrete fact and if the miraculous 
              fact is only distinguished from all other facts precisely by its 
              structure as a concrete fact, then the miraculous fact lies eternally 
              outside the domain of science. Moreover, while the miraculous fact 
              is inaccessible to us through an explanation, it brings with itself 
              and, by its very presence, immediately shows us those connections 
              between orders of causes which we cannot usually see. In a certain 
              manner it has an intelligibility of its own, which non-miraculous 
              facts do not. In the miracle of Fatima, for instance, the vision 
              that the children had &#8212; the miraculous cures, the lights that 
              appeared in the sky, the dance of the sun, the Russian Revolution, 
              World War II &#8212; all this is shown as bearing internal connections, 
              which we usually fail to see. This means that the miraculous event 
              cannot be explained in itself, yet by itself and its own material 
              structure it throws light on causal connections that we cannot usually 
              see. So, in a certain manner, the inexplicable miraculous event 
              has a force &#8212; I would say not an explicative but an illuminative 
              force &#8212; that allows us then to see connections that before 
              we did not. In this sense, the miraculous fact has the structure 
              of what in other domains is called a symbol.</p>
            <p>Symbol was defined by the philosopher Susanne K. Langer &#8212; 
              one of the finest scholars in this field &#8212; as the matrix of 
              all intellection. That is to say, a symbol is not something that 
              you understand in itself, but something that helps you to understand 
              a number of other things. Take, for instance, the biblical narratives. 
              Many times you do not understand what is going on there, but later 
              on, as you start to find facts in real life analogous to the facts 
              in the narratives, the observed facts become intelligible, thanks 
              to the unifying power of symbols; several facts are joined under 
              a species that is condensed into the symbol. That is exactly what 
              the miraculous fact does; we do not understand it, but it throws 
              light on innumerable causal connections that are usually not visible 
              to us. This characteristic is proper to the miraculous phenomenon. 
              Any phenomenon, of course, if regarded in a certain manner, can 
              be symbolic, but the fact regarded as miraculous already has a symbolic 
              structure in itself, and it is inseparable from this symbolic structure. 
              It is this inseparability of its presence from its symbolic character 
              that is the distinctive feature of the miraculous phenomenon.</p>
            <p>In the first instance, it is not the miracle that has to be understood. 
              Rather it is everything else that has to be understood in the light 
              of the miracle. Each and every fact may be regarded symbolically, 
              but the miracle has to be so. It does not admit of being looked 
              on otherwise. Why? Because it is the nature of the miracle to physically 
              show those connections between several causal orders which usually 
              do not appear to us, and that is precisely what symbols do.</p>
            <p>Do you understand this? Seen in this manner, the miraculous fact 
              does not have to be explained, because the miraculous fact is the 
              source of all explanation; it is the miraculous fact that throws 
              light on all the rest. And that is precisely whence its name &#8212; 
              miraculum &#8212; comes: something worthy of being looked at, worthy 
              of being contemplated. So what Aristotle said about rites of mysteries 
              in general also applies to miracles: they teach us nothing, but 
              leave a deep impression upon us (these are not Aristotle's words, 
              but my own way of putting it) that acts like a vitamin, so to speak, 
              upon our intelligence. He thus anticipated Susanne K. Langer's definition 
              of symbol as the matrix of all intellection. A miracle is not to 
              be explained in itself but to be contemplated (distinguished, obviously 
              enough, from other phenomena) and to be used thereafter as a matrix 
              for the understanding of many things that are happening at that 
              same time and that are to happen from that time on.</p>
            <p>The miraculous phenomenon has characteristics that no other phenomenon 
              does. One of these characteristics is that it cannot be understood 
              in itself, i.e., it cannot be explanatorily comprehended in itself, 
              but it throws some light on other facts. This is the true criterion 
              for the study of miraculous facts. . . . </p>
