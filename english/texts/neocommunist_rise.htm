      <p>The usual distinction between a “totalitarian Left” and a “democratic Left” has been for at least ten years a founding premise of the American vision of Latin America. The rise of leftist parties to power in many Latin-American countries in recent years has been insistently focused under such a perspective, and even President Bush's visit to Brazil last November was guided by the persuasion that the only venomous snake in Latin America was Hugo Chavez and that the virtual antidote to its bite was Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

<p>That the radical and totalitarian Left's acension to power could and should be thwarted by the strenghtening of the democratic Letf became some sort of common wisdom both in American media and in American foreign policy. </p>
<p>However valid in general and abstract terms, both that distinction and any diagnosis of Latin American politics that are based on it are completely out of purpose under the present circumstances. Most of the continent's leftist parties are affiliated to the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, the general headquarters of Latin-American neo-communism, founded in 1990 by Fidel Castro and Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The Forum held twelve general assemblies, whose proceedings were long time supressed but can now be acessed at my electronic newspaper <a href="http://www.midiasemmascara.org/">www.midiasemmascara.org </a>. Its resolutions, invariably signed by the unanimity of the members, have a mandatory character for all the affiliated organizations of the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum. They outline the blueprint for the conquest of total power over the continent. </p>
<p>Even a perfunctory examination of these papers (most of them in Spanish) shows the strategical unity behind the different lines followed by the several leftist parties and organizations in Latin America. Crime, drug dealing and guerilla warfare are not therein opposed to legal democratic politics, but skilfully articulated to it for the best overall success of the general strategy, intented, as declared at the occasion of the 4.

<p>The contents of the resolutions were publicly confirmed by the Brazilian president himself. In a very important speech delivered last July, to which both the international midia and the American government seem to have played only little attention if any, he detailed some of the ways the Forum interferes decisively in the domestic policy of several Latin-American countries. </p>

<p>Not only the cult of the guerilla heroes is still a living tradition in Latin American parties, but everywhere still prevails in leftist circles the old leninist rule that legal and illegal tactics should be cleverly articulated according to circumstances. </p>
