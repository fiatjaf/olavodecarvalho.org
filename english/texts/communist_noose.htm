            Slowly and stealthily the U.S. is being surrounded as the chess
            pieces of the Baran-Wallerstein strategy fall into place, including
            a new pact in the "spirit of cooperation" between traditional
            enemies China and India. They have resolved all border disputes,
            have new trade agreements, and are part of the bigger BRIC alliance,
            that is, Brazil, Russia, India, and China.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may wonder how Brazil fits into the picture. The U.S. is aware
            of the Iran, Syria, Russia alliance to our east, which has support
            from France and Germany, those governments on the Security Council
            which took oil vouchers from Saddam in exchange for U.N. opposition
            to our attempts to remove Saddam. Incidentally, in case you missed
            it, this week Jacky Chirac named a new PM, none other than Dominique
            deVillepin, notorious for his remark in favor of more stalling on
            behalf of Saddam, "Now we know that inspections work!" Now only
            Britain remains as a true ally in Europe.

            In the Far East, our preoccupation was with North Korea, and
            supposedly we thought that China would keep Kim Jong in line, but
            this was wishful thinking. Japan is the equivalent of Britain as an
            ally in the Far East, but they lack military preparedness. Taiwan is
            the sitting duck ally, with a multitude of Chinese missiles pointed
            its way, ready to fire whenever China decides to take back Taiwan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seemingly Hindu India makes a strange bedfellow with Communist
            China, but India is in part reacting to America's supplying Pakistan
            with missiles; however, Muslim Pakistan is an even stranger
            bedfellow for the U.S., and certainly an unreliable ally should the
            government prove unable to control the fervor of that country's
            jihadiis. Unknown to most, and never mentioned in the news, is the
            presence in India of an indigenous Marxist movement known as the
            Naxalites. Indeed, India has focused most of its attention on
            Naxalite terrorists in Kashmir, which are financed and organized by
            Pakistan!
          </p>
          <p>
            Former Indian intelligence servicemen founded the
            <em>South Asian Intelligence Review </em>to keep tabs on this and
            other terrorist organizations. Retired intelligence director K. P.
            Singh estimates the Naxalites raise up to $40 million a year, and
            unfortunately the Indian government has treated the Naxalites as a
            local law enforcement problem, much in the way that Clinton did by
            turning down Sudan's offer to extradite bin Laden on the grounds
            that he had not yet committed a crime in America.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the Mafia of old, Naxalites raise money mostly from extortion
            in remote rural villages where the government's presence is scarce.
            But they also provide some social services that serve to enable them
            to proselytize effectively. Think the Salvation Army with a gun.
            Once someone becomes a follower, he is provided with food and
            housing.

            The targets are usually local police, but in 2003 they tried to
            assassinate Chief Minister Naidu of Andhra Pradesh state, leaving
            him with serious injuries. Support of opposition candidates risks
            beheading, so it is no wonder that Naxalites have grown since 2003
            from nine Indian states comprising 55 districts to 13 states and 170
            districts by February of this year. This rapid expansion coincides
            with the Maoist cadre in Nepal that rules much of that nation's
            rural areas. Representatives of these two terrorist organizations
            met in Calcutta four years ago where they laid out a plan for a
            "compact revolutionary zone" to reach from Nepal to southern India.
            The Naxalites' origins go back to a 1967 peasant uprising in
            Naxalbarin in West Bengal. Ajai Sahni, editor of the
            <em>South Asian Intelligence Review, </em>concedes that there may be
            10,000 cadres of Naxalites, with substantially more supporters.
          </p>
          <p>
            China is poised to move east, threatening Taiwan with
            "reunification," while also threatening Japan, two nations which are
            our true allies, while South Korea seems to waffle further on
            whether or not they want our military support or "reunification"
            with North Korea.
          </p>
          <p>
            But unknown to most is the way that China has been expanding its
            sphere of influence West, that is, beyond India into many of the
            former Soviet republics. Indeed, one of the most underreported news
            items is about the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Bet you never
            heard of it; nevertheless, it is now perhaps <em>the </em>most
            important part of the B-W strategy to isolate and strangle America.
            First of all, the SCO alliance between Russia and China demonstrates
            that despite all talk of liberalization in Russia and China,
            Communists cannot change their stripes. In June 2001, Russia and
            China signed a treaty, including Central Asian nations of the former
            Soviet Union, which pledges each nation to come to the aid of the
            others when these nations deem that their security is being
            threatened by the "three evils of separatism, extremism and
            terrorism."

          </p>
          <p>
            Thus China's claim to Tibet, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan would
            activate a reaction from Russia and the other nations should Taiwan
            resist reunification. And make no mistake, the pact's designation of
            terrorism does not mean that these nations will aid us in
            <em>our </em>fight against Islamo-fascism, for Russia and China are
            not only financing terrorism, but China has made proliferation of
            missiles an extension of diplomacy, just as has Kim Jong. Not
            surprisingly, China and Russia are pushing to include Iran in the
            SCO. I reported earlier that Russia had signed a joint pact with
            Iran and Syria, so all but a "see-no-evil" liberal in the U.S.
            Congress can see that we are being surrounded by nuclear-armed
            nations utilizing Third World terrorists, as the Communist
            strategists of the B-W theory move their chess pieces into position
            for an eventual cataclysmic confrontation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should Bush move carrier battle groups into the vicinity of a
            beleaguered Taiwan, China has enough massed mainland missiles to
            threaten our ships. Moreover, one of Clinton's gifts to China in
            exchange for their largess with campaign donations was a torpedo
            designed to explode <em>under </em>carriers. It would seem that the
            time is rapidly approaching when our days as a power in the Pacific
            will be numbered.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we seem to have fought Islamo-fascism to a standstill at
            present, Iran, which suffered mightily at the hands of Iraq, now has
            designs on killing two birds with one stone, that is, occupying
            Iraq, while throwing out the American "crusaders." Should Iran make
            a move, Syria, which has all of Saddam's WMDs, may simultaneously
            invade Iraq from the west, with the full support of its pact ally,
            Russia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the potential threats developing both east and west of the
            U.S., can we take any comfort from the situation to the south of us.

            Better sit down kiddies, and have a stiff drink. Remember I began by
            citing the BRIC alliance. That's Brazil, along with Russia, India
            and China. Maybe you are skeptical of any harm coming from Brazil.
            But why do you think Condi Rice spent five days traveling to Brazil,
            El Salvador, Columbia and Chile in late April? She was hoping to get
            a commitment from Brazilian President Luis Lula da Silva to rally
            other democracies against Communist Venezuelan President Hugo
            Chavez, but she was told point blank by Brazil's Foreign Minister
            Celso Amorin that Venezuela's sovereignty would be respected by
            Brazil, and indeed protected.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last pieces of B-W strategy in regard to South America began to
            fall into place in May 2004, when Lula da Silva visited Beijing and
            called for "the democratization of international relations and
            global multipolarization." "Democratization" = Communization,
            Communist New Speak for ending America's pre-eminence on the world
            stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Historically Communists use more than words to convert the
            unwilling, and Chinese President Hu Jintao came to Brazil in
            November bearing gifts: Said Lula, "China helped us send satellites
            into orbit and we, in return, offer techniques to China in the
            manufacture of airplanes."
          </p>
          <p>
            You may recall that American manufactured satellites never got off
            Chinese launching pads or went awry, until the Manchurian candidate
            sent Loral technicians to fine-tune China's missile program, in
            exchange for big campaign donations not only from the Chinese but
            from Loral's president, Bernie Schwartz. Now China is doing the
            liberal thing by gifting its missile expertise, for Brazil has plans

            Moreover, China is backing Brazil's move for a seat on the Security
            Council. In turn, Brazil supports Beijing's "one China" claim to
            Taiwan.

            But Venezuela is the eye of the Communist hurricane in South
            America. Official U.S. protests to the Russian embassy over the sale
            of 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles to Venezuela brought a curt "Don't
            meddle in our affairs." The Russians are of course one of Mr.
            Kerry's "allies." It would be nice to see him in fatigues again,
            sporting a Kalashnikov and fighting alongside his other ally, the
            Chinese, who have sent "trainers" and "advisors" to support Chavez's
            many "insurrections" in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Indeed, China
            has been accused by American and Columbian officials of supporting
            the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC). As to Kerry's
            other ally, you have to admire the French for their persistence in
            arming our enemies. Even though the Israelis destroyed the reactor
            sold by France to Saddam, France announced this week that they would
            sell a reactor to Libya.

            Now pick up the Cuban piece of the B-W puzzle and drop it into place
            with the BRIC, and all of the insurrections in South America, for
            both Chavez and Lula are disciples of Castro, and Venezuela supplies
            him with oil. Certainly 100,000 rifles can support an awful lot of
            insurrections, but seemingly they would have little impact on
            America. But get this. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti, reported
            last month that Russia and Venezuela are about to do a $250 million
            deal whereby Venezuela would acquire two squadrons of SU-27 Flanker
            fighters with a combat range of nearly 1,000 miles, enabling them to
            dogfight over the entire Caribbean and Central America. Moreover,
            what is to stop them from using bases in Cuba?

            Earlier in February, as part of the rifle deal, Chavez bought ten
            MI-17 and MI-26 helicopters from Russia.

          <p>
            Yes, by means of all the alliances I have cited above, the Communist
            noose is definitely tightening around America. Thanks to that other
            Democrat fellow-traveler Jimmy Carter, China also controls both ends
            of the Panama Canal. And with the open border policy of the Bush
            administration, it is chilling to think that one or more of the
            multitude of foreign nationals coming over our borders may be
            carrying a suitcase nuke.
