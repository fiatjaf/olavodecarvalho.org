          <p>Mr. de Carvalho,</p>
          <p>
            Thank you very much for sending me your thoughtful and eloquent
            analysis of the current political situation in Brazil. As you know,
            one of my brief articles, &#147;Blocking a New Axis&#148; has
            circulated widely by email &#150; I am told more than 400,000
            brazilians have received it. It has led to an active but nonfactual
            protest by many supporters of Lula.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought you would find it interesting to have the text of my
            analysis on Brazil and on the Chavez regime in Venezuela &#150;
            where I correctly warned about his radical political actions in
            1999. Also, I think the list of participants at the lastest Lula
            organized Foro de Sao Paolo in Havanna is very indicitive, as you
            discussed in your analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Very important is Lula&#146;s statement on September 14 opposing
            Brazil&#146;s continued participation in the Nuclear Noproliferation
            Treaty. I am enclosing that in Portuguese as well as a
            just-published <i>O Globo</i> story saying the truth that Lula
            supports Brazil&#146;s having nuclear weapons &#150; a fact that
            seems virtually unknown to most voters in Brazil.
          </p>
          <p>With all good wishes.</p>

            September 1999
          </p>
          <p>
            During his coming visit to the U.S., President Hugo Chavez of
            Venezuela hopes to meet again with President Clinton. In January
            1999, Col. Chavez told President Clinton that his political program
            would be one of &#147;true democracy&#148;, but in fact, he is
            establishing a radical military dictatorship with ominous
            implications for the people of Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico and for
            the United States as he moves forward with his plans for a
            <i>de facto</i> alliance with Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya and communist
            China. Now, it is up to President Clinton to exercise leadership in
            formulating a strategy to help the people of Venezuela reestablish
            their democracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venezuela, with a population of about 23 million, is currently the
            largest single supplier of oil to the United States. After the
            restoration of democracy in 1958, Venezuela had been a positive
            example for all of Latin America and had excellent relations with
            the United States. Unfortunately, the deep recession following the
            1982 and 1994 Latin American debt crises severely reduced living
            standards where about half of the population had been middle class.
            This, along with corruption scandals involving both major democratic
            political parties and the effects of low oil prices during the
            1990s, contributed to growing public demands for reform.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his time as a military cadet, Chavez came to believe that he
            should lead a radical military regime which would transform
            Venezuela. In 1992 he staged a violent military coup in coalition
            with the armed Venezuelan communist movements established with
            Castro&#146;s help in the 1960s. This was repelled by the National
            Guard, equal in strength to the army.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having been given amnesty in 1995, Chavez began to focus his efforts
            on the political process. He organized the Bolivarian Revolutionary
            Movement, reestablished his alliance with the Venezuelan
            Marxist-Leninist movements and began working with the communist
            guerrillas of Colombia who helped his movement in return for stolen
            weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first tests for Chavez&#146;s new movement were the November
            1998 elections for the National Congress and for 22 state
            governorships. Contrary to their hopes, the Chavez movement won only
            37% of the seats in the Congress and only 8 of the 22 governorships.
            Yet, as they prepared for the December 1998 presidential elections,
            the two long established democratic parties were demoralized by
            public disaffection with them as a result of corruption in
            government. Only late in the campaign did they endorse the candidacy
            of Governor Salas Romer, who led a new democratic movement, Projecto
            Venezuela. Chavez campaigned for the presidency on a program of
            reform to end corruption, opposition to &#147;neo-liberalism&#148;
            and strong criticism of the United States. Chavez did not deny that
            his well funded presidential campaign received help from Libya and
            Cuba (reports suggest that Saddam Hussein also provided funds). In
            the election, Gov. Salas Romer received 40% of the popular vote,
            while Col. Chavez won the presidency with 56%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since becoming president on February 2, 1999, Chavez has acted
            systematically to establish a radical military dictatorship under
            the guise of constitutional reform. First, he appointed his fellow
            coup plotters to positions in control of the armed forces, the
            intelligence service, the internal revenue service, the ministry of
            the interior and other sensitive ministries. Second, Chavez has
            created an atmosphere of political intimidation, in which political,
            civic, and media leaders were called upon to support his changes or
            risk being charged with corruption, having mobs storm their offices
            and homes, or finding themselves or family members kidnapped by
            Colombian guerrillas. Third, in direct violation of the
            constitution, Chavez has established regional military committees as
            a form of parallel government in most of Venezuela&#146;s states and
            has sought to force the elected governors and mayors to subordinate
            themselves to these military committees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chavez called a referendum in April 1999 to decide whether a
            Constituent Assembly should be convened to write a new constitution
            for Venezuela. The democratic parties did not feel there was any
            need for a new constitution. Only 39% of Venezuelans voted, but the
            referendum passed. In the July 1999 elections held for the
            Constituent Assembly, only a few persons dared to oppose those from
            the Chavez movement. This reflected the fear pervading members of
            the democratic political parties. As a result, Chavez controls 98%
            of the Constituent Assembly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In August 1999, the Constituent Assembly acted to neutralize and
            usurp the authority of the existing judiciary and of
            Venezuela&#146;s elected Congress. On August 19, 1999, the
            Venezuelan Supreme Court, having been subjected to hidden and open
            coercion, reversed its earlier decision and ruled that the
            Constituent Assembly could declare a &#147;judicial emergency&#148;
            and establish its own group to &#147;review and evaluate&#148; all
            existing judges. The head of the Supreme Court resigned in protest.
            On August 25 the Constituent Assembly declared a &#147;legislative
            emergency&#148; and forbade the Congress from meeting. After members
            of the Congress protested and these actions began to gain
            international attention, there was a temporary, minor compromise
            with the Congress while Chavez continued to take more power.
          </p>
          <p>
            If Chavez consolidates his dictatorship the people of Venezuela will
            experience the repression and poverty that the Cuban people have
            known for the last four decades. Also, Chavez will seek to help
            radicals taker power in other Latin American countries beginning
            with Colombia. There the elected government faces three armed
            opponents &#150; 20,000 communist guerrillas who began with
            Castro&#146;s help in the early 1960s, these are mainly financed by
            violent narcotics traffickers, some of whom also fund and use the
            third armed group, anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces. The actions
            of Chavez make it clear that he seeks to help the Colombian
            guerrillas win directly or by means of a &#147;power-sharing&#148;
            negotiated political settlement. Chavez will also use the slogans of
            &#147;reform&#148; and &#147;ending corruption&#148; to help
            radicals take power in other fragile countries such as Mexico.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key Chavez advisor defines the U.S. Europe and Israel as the
            &#147;white Judaic North&#148;, oppressing the poor of the world and
            requiring the Chavez regime to ally itself with the anti-U.S. oil
            producers &#150; Libya, Iran, Iraq and communist China. Chavez has
            already coordinated closely with Iran to promote higher oil prices,
            he has invited Saddam Hussein to the OPEC summit in Venezuela and he
            has agreed to provide Venezuelan oil to Cuba at a steep discount.
            Chavez will seek ever higher oil prices both to punish the
            &#147;North&#148; and to provide his and other radical regimes with
            more money to oppose it and help &#147;liberate&#148; those they
            define as oppressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In April 1999 Senator Timiteo Zambrano, from one of Venezuela&#146;s
            two major democratic parties, wrote the Organization of American
            States (OAS) stating that Chavez was &#147;against the democratic
            system&#148; and asking for international help to preserve
            democracy. In 1991 the OAS had unanimously agreed that in the event
            of a threat to political democracy the members of the OAS would take
            preventive actions. It is very late but not yet too late. President
            Clinton has a last chance to work with democratic allies to prevent
            the consolidation of a Chavez dictatorship &#150; a major new threat
            to freedom, peace and national security.

          <p align="center">
            <i>The Washington Times</i><br />
            April 28, 2002
          </p>
          <p>
            The recent events in Venzuela were dramatic. Yet much of the
            discussion in the United States began and ended with the fact that
            President Hugo Chavez had been &#147;democratically elected&#148; in
            1998. Ignored were his record of anti-democratic governance since
            taking office in 1999, his alliances with terrorist partner states
            like Cuba, Iraq and Iran, his sponsorship of state terrorism and the
            implications of these facts for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            On April 9-10, 2002, hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters
            from pro-democratic political parties, labor unions, business and
            civic associations, walked in the Venezuelan capital to show their
            opposition the latest anti-democratic actions of Chavez. In
            response, Chavez mobilized his para-military armed thugs, the
            &#147;Bolivarian Circles&#148; and they were televised shooting the
            unarmed protestors killing and wounding more than 100 while others
            sped around Caracas on motorcycles looking for journalists to
            attack. Chavez also sent armed supporters to close down television
            reporting of the protests.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Chavez ordered the military to use force to halt the peaceful
            demonstrations, thirty senior officers refused to obey. They said
            Chavez had violated &#147;democratic principles&#148; and that they
            would no longer recognize his authority because they wanted to
            &#147;avoid more spilling of blood and the destruction of our brave
            people and their institutions&#148;. From their point of view, those
            military leaders were joining a broad based civic movement calling
            for the end of the emerging Chavez dictatorship, just as had
            occurred in 1945 and again in 1958 when a civil-military coalition
            removed a dictator and Venezuela began its four decades as a
            political democracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the reasons all the pro-democratic groups in Venezuela
            oppose Chavez requires a brief review of his anti-democratic actions
            which have been mostly ignored outside of Venezuela. Chavez moved
            Venezuela through four principal phases. First, the use of illegal
            and pseudo-legal means to invalidate the existing constitution (in
            force since 1961) and have a new constitution written by his
            supporters (1999). Second, under the new constitution, having
            himself eligible to be president for two six year terms and
            obtaining a unicameral legislature that would give him predominant
            federal powers. Third, beginning his &#147;social revolution&#148;
            by using presidential decrees in the fall of 2001 to begin
            confiscating private property. The fourth phase, begun in January
            2002 when Chavez established the Political Command of the Revolution
            under his direct control which would supervise the &#147;Bolivarian
            Circles&#148;, an armed militia of Chavez supporters who would
            intimidate, preempt and if necessary seek to defeat the
            political/civic opposition and the Venezuelan armed forces. This was
            intended to assure his indefinite continuation in power.
          </p>
          <p>
            In April 1999 Chavez called a referendum to decide whether a
            Constituent Assembly should be convened to write a new constitution
            for Venezuela. The major democratic parties did not feel there was
            any need for a new constitution, but demoralized and intimidated,
            they made virtually no effort to contest the issue. The lack of
            citizen support for a new constitution was seen in the fact that
            only 39% of Venezuelans voted. Venezuelans voted and passed the
            referendum.
          </p>
          <p>
            In July 1999, elections were held to choose the delegates for the
            Constituent Assembly. Chavez supporters were confident, active and
            intimidating while those representing the pro-democratic parties
            were fearful and only beginning to return to political activity. The
            groups opposing Chavez received 38% of the votes compared to the 42%
            for the pro-Chavez slates of candidates. Nevertheless, by a
            fraudulent process the pro-Chavez 42% of the votes was translated
            into 93% of the seats in the Constituent Assembly while the
            opposition parties received only 7% of the seats.

            In August 1999, the Chavez-dominated Constituent Assembly assembled
            and immediately took actions to neutralize and usurp the authority
            of the existing judiciary and of Venezuela's elected Congress, where
            Chavez supporters had won only 20% of the seats.
          </p>
          <p>
            On August 25, 1999 the Constituent Assembly, in violation of the
            existing constitution, declared a &#147;legislative emergency&#148;
            and forbade the elected national Congress from meeting. From that
            time on, the elected national Congress was sidelined; this marked
            the Chavez regime in complete violation of the Venezuelan
            constitution and as antidemocratic. Democratic political leaders in
            Venezuela appealed to the OAS, the Clinton Administration, and other
            countries to speak out against these unconstitutional actions but
            heard only silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the new constitution, Chavez obtained reelection as president
            and a new legislature where his supporters held 60% of the seats,
            but the democratic opposition parties held the rest, a sign of their
            revival. But independent observers such as the Catholic Church
            questioned the accuracy of the vote counting process for both the
            presidential and legislative elections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chavez now moved to use pseudo-electoral means to put his loyalists
            in control of the powerful independent labor unions grouped together
            in the Venezuelan Confederation of Labor (CTV). It has a long
            history of supporting political democracy, opposing dictatorship,
            and a well organized membership of more than one million strong. On
            December 3, 2000, Chavez held a national referendum on whether all
            the union leaders should be dismissed from their positions. With
            turnout only 23 percent, the referendum passed. Labor leaders
            claimed the referendum violated the Chavez 1999 constitution,
            provisions of which protect union leaders from state intervention.
            Nevertheless, the CTV leadership was required to resign and run in
            new union elections for office where 80% of previous CTV leaders
            were reelected. Having escaped the Chavez takeover attempt, the CTV
            labor unions have been all the more vigorous in their campaign for
            the restoration of democracy and opposition to Chavez. They have
            called a major demonstration for May 1st, 2002.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actions against journalists have been systematic but hidden. They
            include anonymous threats, ostensibly criminal attacks, and &#150;
            perhaps most intended to intimidate &#150; sending journalists
            verbatim transcripts of their conversations with democratic
            opposition leaders whether on their cell phones, in their offices,
            or elsewhere. This disguised repression of a free press will
            undoubtedly increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internationally, Chavez has established alliances with Cuba, Iraq
            and Iran, all state supporters of terrorism. He has provided the
            Castro regime with free oil, probably worth two billion dollars, and
            worked closely with Castro in support of the communist guerillas in
            Colombia and other anti-democratic movements attacking nearby
            countries. Even the Clinton Administration departed from its silence
            on Chavez, stating in December 2000 that he was supporting
            &#147;violent movements opposing the government of Colombia, Bolivia
            and Ecuador&#148;. There has been an increasing flow of credible
            evidence, including from Chavez&#146;s former chief of intelligence,
            that the Chavez regime has been and remains a state supporter of
            terrorism through its aid for the Colombian communist guerillas and
            other radical groups. If and as Chavez consolidates his control in
            the coming weeks and months, his actions will threaten democracy in
            Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil.

            Saturday, September 14th, 2002
          </p>
          <p>
            Yesterday, before an audience of officials of the Armed Forces and
            ambassadors, PT&#146;s candidate for President, Luiz In&aacute;cio
            Lula da Silva, criticized Brazil&#146;s participation in the Treaty
            of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. When ambassador Marcos
            Camilo Curtis asked him if he considered the treaty harmful to
            national interests and to Brazilian sovereignty, he answered:
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;I will be very sincere, because within Congress there is a
            great majority of pacifist deputies who think Brazil should join the
            treaty. But, as a citizen, I think it would only make sense if all
            the countries that already have (nuclear weapons) gave theirs up.
            Because if a citizen asks me to disarm, keep a slingshot and points
            a cannon at me, what advantage is it to me?&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            Da Silva pointed out that there are still three ways for a country
            to be respected in the world: having a solid economy, a lot of
            technology or being strong militarily. In his opinion, the only
            country which presently has a long term strategy is the United
            States, precisely because it is hegemonic in economy, technology and
            in the military.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;It is because of this that we were forced to watch Bush in his
            speech on TV yesterday trying to find a reason to invade Iraq.&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            In an interview after the speech in the Air Forces Club, da Silva
            explained his opinion in relation to the treaty. The candidate said
            that the lack of a clause that would prevent the developed countries
            from building nuclear weapons had put Brazil and other
            underdeveloped countries in a disadvantage situation. But da Silva
            stated that there is no way of re-accessing the agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;It is not fair that the developed countries, which have the
            technology of nuclear weapons, demand that the others should not
            have them and do not de-activate their own. Then, all of us in
            developing countries have mere slingshots while they have the atomic
            bomb&#148; &#150; stated the candidate, reassuring though, that he
            maintains the motto &#145;peace and love&#146;.
          </p>
          <p align="center"><b>Bolsonaro is impressed</b></p>
          <p>
            Da Silvas&#146;s nationalist discourse surprised even the most
            radical sectors of the military. After listening to the candidate,
            deputy Jair Bolsonaro (PPB-RJ), a reformed military man, did not
            hesitate in revealing that the Workers&#146; Party candidate will
            have his vote in the second turn, if the candidate of the Work
            Front, Ciro Gomes, doesn&#146;t make it. In his opinion, the meeting
            helped reduce old resistances of his class to the P-tist.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;I was impressed. We have to forget the bad things from the
            past on both sides. I harbor no resentment, nor do my colleagues
            from the barracks.&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            The Vice-president of the Chamber&#146;s Committee of Foreign
            Relations and National Defense, Paulo Delgado (PT-MG), was
            astonished by what da Silva had said:
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;Brazil&#146;s strength is in its continental territory and its
            population. With 10 neighbors and 17 thousand kilometers of borders,
            it is better to have friends than to have an arsenal. Pacifism is a
            republican victory&#148;, he said.

          <p>
            Although the toucan<sup><a name="5" href="#nota5">5</a></sup>
            candidate to the Presidency, Jos&eacute; Serra, had said not to be
            worried about the possibility of the victory of the PT&#146;s
            candidate, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, right in the first
            turn, he took advantage of an interview after the meeting with the
            military in Rio to open fire against the P-tist. The toucan said
            that da Silva has been hiding behind the publicity agent of his
            campaign, Duda Mendon&ccedil;a, and behind the Attorney General Luiz
            Francisco de Souza, who filed a lawsuit yesterday against Ricardo
            S&eacute;rgio de Oliveira, ex-treasurer of Serra&#146;s campaign.
          </p>
          <p>
            He accused the P-tist of being in favour of the atomic bomb and
            said, criticizing da Silva, that an electoral campaign cannot be
            waged on a base of peace and love.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;We aim to have political questions exposed. Da Silva has been
            hiding a lot. He goes to the debate, there is Garotinho<sup
              ><a name="6" href="#nota6">6</a></sup
            >. On TV, you have Duda Mendon&ccedil;a&#146;s <i>Lula Light</i>.
            Now the P-tist Attorney General is there too. It is time he shows
            his true colors so we may debate.&#148;, said Serra.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an interview in the Hotel Gloria, three times over the toucan
            mentioned the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, signed
            by Brazil, saying that da Silva is against the agreement and,
            therefore, in favour of the atomic bomb. On Friday, during the
            meeting with the military the P-tist criticised the treaty, but
            claimed not to have any intention of re-examining it.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;He is against the Treaty of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
            Weapons. So, he is in favor of Brazil making the atomic bomb. I am
            against. I think that these are important questions for the people.
            I want to debate them&#148;, explained Serra.
          </p>
          <p align="center"><b>&#147;I have the right to demand it&#148;</b></p>
          <p>
            According to him, his campaign cannot be classified as attacks
            against the P-tist.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;That does not even exist because personally I respect da
            Silva. From the political stand point, we have the right to demand.
            If da Silva defends the atomic bomb, we are interested to see how.
            If he defends ten million jobs, he must show us how. These things
            are not solved with speeches.&#148;
          </p>
          <p>The toucan justified the tone of his campaign:</p>
          <p>
            &#147;People must have a clear vision of the person they will elect.
            If it is a new edition, if it is only to affect the media. They may
            or may not vote for me, but I am presenting myself as I am.&#148;,
            he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another target of Serra&#146;s criticism was the relation of PT with
            the MST<sup><a name="7" href="#nota7">7</a></sup> and with the
            Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The toucan demanded
            that da Silva take a position about the topic:
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;MST had relations with the Farc. Is that right? What does da
            Silva think? MST invasions will stop if he wins? And if another
            wins, will they happen? As if this was a game, illegitimate from
            democracy&#146;s standpoint.&#148;
          </p>
          <p>
            Serra avoided suggesting that PT&#146;s president, Jos&eacute;
            Dirceu<sup><a name="8" href="#nota8">8</a></sup
            >, was directly responsible for the aggression against governor
            Mario Covas during a teachers&#146; strike in 2000. Yesterday the
            toucan program showed images of a speech in which Dirceu says that
            rulers should be beaten in the ballots and in the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#147;I did not see the program. But I remember the occasion.
            Probably, he was not responsible, but he said what he said. I have
            no objection and I would not be outraged if someone put me on TV
            saying something I said.&#148;

          <p>Dear friends,</p>
          <p>
            Mr. Menges analysis is completely right. Mr. da Silva is a main
            Brazilian supporter of Colombian FARC, whose representative in
            Brazil is Fernando Beira-Mar, a cruel and sadistic criminal whose
            gang frightens our people, our government and even our Army. Brazil
            is up to the point of becoming a new Colombia, owing to people like
            Mr. Lula da Silva and Beira-Mar. This is not just an opinion.
            It&#146;s a fact. People who try to cover facts under
            pseudo-patrioric rethorics are not real patriots. They are just
            stupid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Mr. Menges is not a US government official, he is just an
            intelligence analyst who tries to understand what is happening in
            Brazil. If a simple press article is an &#147;undue interference in
            Brazilian affairs&#148;, then all press commentary in foreign
            newspapers concerning Brazilian politics should be prohibited,
            except those favorable to Mr. da Silva, of course.
          </p>
          <p>
            To say that Mr. da Silva&#146;s enemies intend to &#147;overthrow
            the government and remilitarize Brazil&#148; is a huge and cynical
            lie. Mr. da Silva is overtly supported by the military, to whom he
            promises government money for nuclear research (appealing to the old
            ambition of making Brazil an anti-american atomic world power &#150;
            exactly what Mr. Menges had foretold). Mr. da Silva is very close to
            ultranationalist military, the most dangerous part of Brazilian
            Armed Forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&#146;s also a lie that the Workers Party (PT) is not a
            revolutionary one. Some months ago a political scientist at Rio
            Grande, Prof. Jos&eacute; Giusti Tavares, wrote that it was a
            revolutionary party and was sued for that. He brought to Justice the
            evidences confirming his dyagnosis (papers from the Party itself)
            and was acquited. Mr. da Silva himself admited to his extreme-left
            supporters that any &#147;light&#148; tone he had adopted in his
            electoral propaganda is just this: electoral propaganda, and nothing
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, some liars and telling people to read <i>O Globo</i> instead
            of believing Mr. Menges. Bullshit. I am myself one of
            <i>O Globo</i>&#146;s columnists, and this is what I wrote there
            some days ago:

            After the downfall of the USSR became an accomplished fact, the
            Forum of S&atilde;o Paulo has been, since 1990, the most powerful
            initiative taken to restart the international communist movement
            and, in Fidel Castro words, &#147;to regain in Latin America what
            was lost in East Europe&#148;. Summoned by the Cuban dictator and
            Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, the Forum joins the legal
            Communist (and pro-Communist) parties, engaged in the struggle for
            cultural and political hegemony within their nations, and armed
            organizations involved in kidnapping, terrorism and drug traffic.
            Among the last, the outstanding one is Farc, whose connections with
            the Brazilian drug market were proven with the arrest of Fernandinho
            Beira-Mar. There are also double-faced organizations, both legal and
            illegal, like the Chilean Communist Party, whose armed wing had
            something to do with the kidnapping of Washington Olivetto.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the readers will at first find strange a meeting in which
            legally organized parties fraternize with criminal gangs. Actually,
            this association only repeats the old Leninist rules that recommend
            the joining of legal and illegal means in the revolutionary
            struggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact one of the advantages of the international alliance is to
            allow that the promiscuous mixture of licit and illicit ways, of
            moralist rhetoric and drug traffic, of beautiful ideals and the
            brutality of kidnappings, of humanitarian sentimentalism and
            organized terror &#150; a mix so clear and evident in continental
            scale, and at meetings of the Forum &#150; that it appears disguised
            and nebulous when seen from the perspective of each separate nation.
            Using Argentineans to act in Mexico, Bolivians in Brazil or
            Brazilians in Chile, the most obvious connections become invisible
            to the eyes of local public opinion: the legal parties continue
            above any suspicion, and the simple suggestion of investigating them
            is rejected as an intolerable offense, when the arrest of criminals
            shows full proof of the intimate association between organized crime
            and leftist politics in the continent; identification that becomes
            still more evident when the arrest of such persons is followed, with
            magical coincidence, by the quick and effective mobilization, for
            the criminals, of officials and &#147;decent folk&#148; of the left.

            Since 1990, the Forum of S&atilde;o Paulo has been meeting
            regularly. The tenth meeting took place in Havana, Cuba, in
            December, 2001. Mr. Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva was there. To
            deny therefore that he is associated politically with the other
            entities, signatories to the declarations of the Forum, it is to
            deny the validity of the Brazilian presidential candidate&#146;s
            signature on official documents of international relevance. As wrote
            Vasconcelo Quadros in the &#147;Isto &Eacute;&#148; of March 2002,
            &#147;Brazil shelters a secret network of support of international
            guerrilla organizations employed in kidnappings, bank robberies and
            drug traffic&#148;. In a country in which any phone call to a
            swindler is enough to place a politician under police suspicion, a
            countrywide refusal to investigate a link enshrined in public
            documents it is, at least, surprising.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still more surprising is that, among so many journalistic
            commentators, policemen, politicians and the military, all them
            reputed as intelligent, nobody gets-or wants-to establish a logical
            link between those facts and the declaration of Dr. Leonardo Boff,
            in &#147;Jornal do Brasil&#148; of August 23, that with the next
            election &#147;the time for the Brazilian revolution will have
            arrived. The sowing was already been done. It is harvest time&#148;.
            Or, when using the word &#147;revolution&#148;, didn&#146;t the
            retired clergyman mean anything of the sort, and that all was
            innocent hyperbole?
          </p>
          <p>
            The massive and obstinate refusal to face with realism this state of
            affairs can be explained by the fact that he constitutes a dreadful
            reality, whose vision would be too traumatic for the delicate nerves
            of a bourgeoisie dandy, terrified to the point of no longer
            admitting the reality of the evil that terrifies him.
            Psychologically kidnapped by a nameless Marxism that permeates the
            air, the dominant class is already ripe to act its role of docile,
            smiling and helpful victim.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, please, don&#146;t think that with those remarks I am acting in
            favor or against any candidate to the Presidency of the Republic.
            See this: four candidates, with token differences, have the same
            ideology, and any one of them, when elected, cannot govern without
            the support of at least one or two of the other three. It is
            therefore of a single slate election, subdivided into four temporary
            denominations. Perhaps what Dr. Boff will not say is that the
            revolution will be inaugurated with the victory of candidate x or y,
            but with &#147;the election&#148; itself-no matter who wins. From
            the psychological point of view, at least, that revolution has
            already begun: the ideological uniformity, once accepted as the
            normal state of the democratic politics, is enough to virtually
            outlaw, as &#147;right wing extremism&#148;, any word henceforth
            said in favor of liberal capitalism, of the USA or of Israel. Who
            says it receives regular death threats, no longer with the
            precaution of delivery as anonymous messages: they are to be seen on
            internet sites and cause no scandal. Dr. Boff is right: Sowing has
            already been done. It is harvest time. But all this certainly is
            mere hyperbole. Yes, it would be a scandal to see some malign
            intention in such innocent words.
