            When any politician of the Right or of no ideological conviction is
            accused of misappropriation of funds and his party tries to elude
            investigation, the media overwhelmingly denounces the malfeasance,
            and with affectations of high dudgeon, calls for
            &#147;transparency&#148;<sup><a name="2" href="#nota2">2</a></sup
            >.
          </p>

            But the president of the Republic has not been accused merely of
            corruption. He has been accused of receiving financial contributions
            from the largest criminal organization on the continent, which is
            responsible for the massive supplying of cocaine to the Brazilian
            market and for transforming Rio de Janeiro into a battlefield, where
            the monthly number of violent deaths is almost equal to the number
            of civilian casualties in Iraq.
          </p>
          <p>
            To discourage the investigation, he did not resort to any
            parliamentary dodge, but rather to direct intimidation, announcing
            that he will prosecute his accuser, representative Albert Fraga
            (PMDB-DF), for the crime of exercising one of the basic prerogatives
            of his parliamentary mandate. At the same time &#150; according to a
            column by Elio Gaspari &#150;, government agents are maneuvering to
            avoid having Boris Casoy<sup><a name="3" href="#nota3">3</a></sup
            >, the only TV interviewer from S&atilde;o Paulo who had the
            audacity to ask da Silva anything about the FARC during the
            electoral campaign, be able to offend the sensitive spirit of the
            president of the Republic again. Maybe it is just concidence, but
            the death threats that I was receiving by e-mail suddenly became
            open calls for my assassination, published on the website of
            &#147;Centro de M&iacute;dia Independente&#148; with the full
            cooperation of its directors, who, disregarding the Brazilian
            Constitution, proudly showed off their habit of posting anonymous
            messages.
          </p>
          <p>
            And no one in the media seems to be scandalized by these things. To
            the contrary, the journalistic class appears to be as caught up in
            concealing the accusation as it is in its repression, the former
            reported only by yours truly and by the &#147;Jornal de
            Bras&iacute;lia&#148;, the latter by tiny little articles tucked
            away in the corners of pages of about a half dozen newspapers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, in parliament and on TV, there is all sorts of fuss and
            noise being made about incomparably lesser crimes attributed to
            Ant&ocirc;nio Carlos Magalh&atilde;es.
          </p>
          <p>
            Derogatory messages about representative Fraga have already begun to
            make their way around the Internet in an operation of
            <i>character assassination</i> intended to undermine the
            public&#146;s interest in the evidence and documents that he plans
            to present in the CPI for whose constitution he now has 114
            colleagues&#146; signatures. I don&#146;t know Alberto Fraga; I
            don&#146;t know anything about his background, but I do know that in
            Fernando Collor&#146;s era<sup><a name="4" href="#nota4">4</a></sup>
            no one cited the poor moral character of his brother Pedro as an
            excuse for not hearing his testimony. I know that no one hesitated
            to call a notorious con artist and murderer as a primary witness
            against the &#147;budget dwarves&#148;<sup
              ><a name="5" href="#nota5">5</a></sup
            >. What do I care, then, if the plaintiff is a good guy or a bad
            guy? All I want is for the evidence that he provides about what
            appears to be the biggest electoral crime of all time to be
            presented. But it doesn&#146;t surprise me that the first ones to
            try to cover it up are the apostles of &#147;transparency&#148;
            themselves: glass ceilings, by definition, are transparent.<sup

            The president of the Republic was founder, and for ten years,
            maximum leader of the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, coordinator of the
            communist movement on the continent, in which legal parties joined
            together in a common strategy with terrorist and criminal
            organizations like the FARC and Chile&#146;s MIR, the latter being
            the largest shareholder in the Brazilian kidnapping industry. This
            alone would be enough to make him appear suspicious, a man whose
            involvement in such shady company should be meticulously
            investigated before giving him the right to popular confidence.
            However, in the 2002 elections, the appelation &#147;S&atilde;o
            Paulo Forum&#148; was totally supressed in the media and in the
            debates. Never, in thirty-seven years in journalism, have I seen an
            effort at concealment so widespread, so cynical, so obstinate. And
            no wonder: among da Silva&#146;s competitors, two were his partners
            in the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, and the third, who knew all,
            wasn&#146;t in the least bit willing to upset, with unpleasant
            discussions, an election intended to be an intimate celebration of
            leftist parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, I wrote quite a bit of commentary against this, but I
            rejected any idea of financial interest in the links between da
            Silva and Colombian narco-guerrillas. Now, given these new
            accusations, the media&#146;s silence ceases being simply immoral
            and has become frankly criminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            How long will it take business, political, and military leaders to
            realize that a revolutionary scheme to which the right to complete
            immunity is granted has already become omnipotent, and nothing can
            stop it from turning Brazil into the communist regime of its dreams?
          </p>
          <p>
            In this country no one else is scandalized that our governing
            officials fall all over themselves in praise of the dictator of Cuba
            the same week in which, to keep the news of the war in Iraq from
            turning against him, Fidel Castro jailed seventy-eight dissidents
            and journalists, imposing life sentences on ten of them. No, no one
            was bothered by that, though there was more than enough wailing over
            the firing of Peter Arnett.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a country&#146;s entire talking elite becomes subservient to
            false communist morals to the point of allowing such a scandalous
            double standard to become the normal standard of judgement, it is
            ready to admit that, in reality, a presidential candidate accepting
            money from drug traffickers is not a big deal, as long as they are
            leftist drug traffickers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The distance which we have progressed on the way to this conclusion
            can be measured by the following: while American schools have taken
            great care that their explanations to their students about the war
            do not lead to political hostility against whomever, our youngest
            children were induced to take part in anti-American demonstrations
            with the promise of better grades. A country that treats its
            children in such a manner, prostituting them <i>en masse</i> with
            leftist manipulation, is ready to accept anything &#150; anything
            &#150; as long as it comes with the correct ideological stamp. Then
            we&#146;ll think it wonderful that someone bring together
            schoolchildren to be human shields.

              political rights for 8 years. It must be noted that: a) he was
              responsible for the first openings of the Brazilian market to the
              outside world and for the beginning of the privatization (as far
              as this term is valid in the Brazilian context) of the state owned
              companies; b) most of the Brazilian people were happy about his
              fall because of, among other reasons, the confiscation he had made
              of millions of savings accounts on a failed heterodox attempt to
              solve the country&#146;s economic problems; c) none of the
